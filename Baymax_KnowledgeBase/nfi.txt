1. Analgesics, Antipyretics,  
Non-Steroidal  
Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
Analgesics are used to relieve/reduce body pain and antipy-
retics are used to reduce elevated body temperature. Non-
opioid analgesics are particularly suitable for relieveing or 
management of pain in musculoskeletal conditions whereas 
the opioid analgesics are more suitable for moderate to severe 
visceral pain. Those non-opioid analgesics which also have 
anti-inflammatory actions include salicylates and NSAIDs; they 
can reduce both pain and inflammation of chronic inflamma-
tory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, but they do not 
alter or modify the disease process itself. For the manage-
ment of rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs (disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs) may favourably influence the outcome 
of the disease. The pain and inflammation of an acute attack 
of gout is treated with a NSAID or colchicine; a xanthine- 
oxidase inhibitor is used for long-term control of gout. Neuro-
genic pain generally responds poorly to conventional anal-
gesics; treatment can be difficult and includes the use of 
carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia and amitriptyline for 
diabetic neuropathy and post-therapeutic neuralgia.

Analgesics, Antipyretics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
1.2 Opioid Analgesics 
Morphine is effective in relieving moderate to severe pain, 
particularly of visceral origin; there is a large variation in 
patient response. Weaker opioids such as codeine are suitable 
for mild to moderate pain.
Morphine remains the most valuable analgesic for severe 
pain. In addition to pain relief it confers a state of euphoria 
and mental detachment; repeated administration may cause 
dependence and tolerance, but this should not be a deterrent 
in the control of pain in terminal illness. Regular use may also 
be appropriate for certain cases of non-malignant pain, but 
specialist supervision is required. In normal doses common 
adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation and 
drowsiness; larger doses produce respiratory depression and 
hypotension.
Codeine is an opioid analgesic much less potent than 
morphine and much less liable, in normal doses, to produce 
adverse effects including dependency. It is effective for mild to 
moderate pain but is too constipating for long-term use.

6. Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives
Acute diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of childhood 
morbidity and mortality; frail and elderly patients are also 
at risk. In adults acute diarrhoea is the most frequent health 
problem of travellers and is increasingly common among HIV-
infected persons. Assessment and correction of dehydration 
and electrolyte disturbance is the priority in all cases of acute 
diarrhoea. Symptomatic relief in adults may be warranted in 
some cases but antidiarrhoeals should never be used in chil-
dren since they do not reduce fluid and electrolyte loss and 
may cause adverse effects.
Diarrhoea persisting for longer than a month is known as 
chronic diarrhoea. A mild malabsorption syndrome, tropical 
enteropathy, is apparent in most healthy indigenous popu-
lations of tropical countries. However the majority of cases 
of chronic diarrhoea have non-infectious causes including 
gluten-sensitivity, inherited metabolic disorders or inflamma-
tory bowel disease.
Bloody diarrhoea is usually a sign of invasive enteric infec-
tion and should be treated with an appropriate anti-infective 
agent.

Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives
6.2 Laxatives
A balanced diet, including adequate fluid intake and fibre is of 
value in preventing constipation.
Before prescribing laxatives, it is important to be sure that 
the patient is constipated and that the constipation is not 
secondary to an underlying undiagnosed complaint. It is also 
important that the patient understands that bowel habit 
can vary considerably in frequency without doing harm. For 
example, some people consider themselves constipated if they 
do not have a bowel movement each day. A useful definition 
of constipation is the passage of hard stools less frequently 
than the patient’s own normal pattern and this should be 
explained to the patient since misconceptions about bowel 
habits have led to excessive laxative use which in turn has led 
to hypokalaemia and an atonic non-functioning colon.
Laxatives should generally be avoided except where straining 
will exacerbate a condition such as angina or increase the risk 
of rectal bleeding as in haemorrhoids. Laxatives are of value in 
drug-induced constipation, for the expulsion of parasites after 
anthelminthic treatment and to clear the alimentary tract 
before surgery and radiological procedures. Prolonged treat-
ment of constipation is rarely, necessary except occasionally 
in the elderly.
There are many different laxatives. These include bulk-forming 
laxatives which relieve constipation by increasing faecal mass 
and stimulating peristalsis, stimulant laxatives which increase 
intestinal motility and often cause abdominal cramp, faecal 
softeners which lubricate and soften impacted faeces and 
osmotic laxatives which act by retaining fluid in the bowel by 
osmosis. Bowel cleansing solutions are used before colonic 
surgery, colonoscopy or radiological examination to ensure 
that the bowel is free of solid contents; they are not a treat-
ment for constipation.

6.3 Oral Rehydration 
Acute diarrhoea in children should always be treated with 
oral rehydration solution according to plan A, B or C as shown. 
Severely dehydrated patients must be treated initially with 
intravenous fluids until they are able to take fluids by mouth. 
For oral rehydration it is important to administer the solution 
in small amounts at regular intervals as indicated below.
Treatment of Dehydration:
Who Recommendations
According to the degree of dehydration, health professionals 
are advised to follow one of the three management plans.
Plan A: No dehydration: Nutritional advice and increased 
fluid intake are sufficient (soup, rice, water and yoghurt, or 
even water). For infants aged under 6 months who have not 
yet started taking solids, oral rehydration solution must be 
presented before offering milk. Mother’s milk or dried milk 
must be given without any particular restrictions. In the case 
of mixed breast-milk/formula feeding, the contribution of 
lactation must be increased.
Plan B: Moderate dehydration: Whatever the child’s age, a 
4-h treatment plan is applied to avoid short-term problems. 
Feeding should not therefore be envisaged initially. It is recom-
mended that parents are shown how to give approximately 
75 ml/kg of oral rehydration solution with a spoon over a 4-h 
period and it is suggested that parents should be watched 
to see how they cope at the beginning of the treatment. A 
larger amount of solution can be given if the child continues 
to have frequent stools. In case of vomiting, rehydration must 
be discontinued for 10 min and then resumed at a slower rate 
(about one teaspoonful every 2 min). The child’s status must 
be re-assessed after 4 h to decide on the most appropriate 
subsequent treatment. Oral rehydration solution should 
continue to be offered once dehydration has been controlled, 
for as long as the child continues to have diarrhoea.
Plan C: Severe dehydration: Hospitalization is necessary, but 
the most urgent priority is to start rehydration. In hospital (or 
elsewhere), if the child can drink, oral rehydration solution 
must be given pending, and even during intravenous infusion 
(20 ml/kg every h by mouth before infusion, then 5 ml/kg 
every h by mouth during intravenous rehydration). For intra-
venous supplementation, it is recommended that compound 
solution of sodium lactate (see chapter 28.2) is administered 
at a rate adapted to the child’s age (infant under 12 months: 30 
ml/kg over 1 h then 70 ml/kg over 5 h; child over 12 months: 
78
NFI-2011
Antidiarrhoeals and Laxatives
the same amounts over 30 min and 2.5 h respectively). If the 
intravenous route is unavailable, a nasogastric tube is also 
suitable for administering oral rehydration solution, at a rate 
of 20 ml/kg every h. If the child vomits, the rate of administra-
tion of the oral solution should be reduced.
Oral Rehydration Salts*
Indications
Dehydration from acute diarrhoea.
Availability 
GLUCOSE SALT SOLUTION 5 and 37.5g. 
Sodium chloride            2.6 g/litre of water
Sodium citrate               2.9 g/litre of water
Potassium chloride       1.5 g/litre of water
Glucose (anhydrous)    13.5 g/litre of water
When glucose and sodium citrate are not 
available, they may be replaced by
Sucrose (common sugar) 27 g/litre of water
Sodium bicarbonate    2.5 g/litre of water
In cases of cholera, oral rehydration salts 
containing a higher concentration of sodium 
may be required to prevent hyponatraemia.
Note: The solution may be prepared either from prepackaged 
sugar/salt mixtures or from bulk substances and water. Solutions 
must be freshly prepared, preferably with recently boiled and 
cooled water. Accurate weighing and thorough mixing and 
dissolution of ingredients in the correct volume of clean water is 
important. Administration of more concentrated solutions can 
result in hypernatraemia.
Dose 
Oral
5g (single use): dissolve in water and drink; 
37.5g: to reconstitute it with 1 litre of clean 
water.
Adult- Fluid and electrolyte loss in acute 
diarrhoea; 200 to 400 ml solution after every 
loose motion.
Precautions 
Renal impairment.
Adverse Effects
Vomiting- 
may 
indicate 
too 
rapid 
administration; 
hypernatraemia 
and 
hyperkalaemia may result from overdose in 
renal impairment or administration of too 
concentrated a solution.

7. Antidotes and Substances  
Used in Poisoning
These notes are only guidelines and it is strongly recom-
mended that poisons information centres (Appendix 5) be 
consulted in cases where there is doubt about the degree of 
risk or about appropriate management.
82
NFI-2011
Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning
7.1 Non specific
General Care and Non-Specific Treatment:
All patients who show features of poisoning should generally 
be admitted to hospital. Patients who have taken poisons with 
delayed actions should also be admitted, even if they appear 
well; delayed-action poisons include acetylsalicylic acid, iron, 
lithium, paracetamol, paraquat, tricyclic antidepressants and 
warfarin. The effects of modified-release or prolonged-release 
preparations are also delayed. However, it is often impossible 
to establish with certainty the identity of the poison and the 
size of the dose but information on the type and timing of 
poisoning may be useful for symptomatic management. Few 
patients require active removal of the poison.
Most patients must be treated symptomatically and moni-
tored. Particular care must be given to maintenance of 
respiration and blood pressure. Assisted ventilation may be 
required. Cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias often 
respond to correction of underlying hypoxia, acidosis, or other 
biochemical abnormalities. Hypothermia which may develop 
in patients who have been unconscious for some hour is best 
treated by wrapping the patient in blankets to conserve body 
heat. Convulsions which are prolonged or recurrent may 
be controlled by intravenous diazepam. In some situations 
removal of the poison from the stomach by gastric lavage 
may be appropriate (see below). Activated charcoal can bind 
many poisons in the stomach and therefore prevent absorp-
tion. Active elimination techniques such as repeated adminis-
tration of activated charcoal can enhance the elimination of 
some drugs after they have been absorbed (see below). Other 
techniques to enhance elimination of poisons after their 
absorption are only practical in hospital and are only suitable 
for a small number of patients and only to a limited number 
of poisons. Methods include haemodialysis and haemop-
erfusion. Alkalinization of urine can be used to increase the 
elimination of salicylates. Forced alkaline diuresis is no longer 
recommended.
Gastric Lavage:
The dangers of attempting to empty the stomach have to 
be balanced against the toxicity of the ingested poison, as 
assessed by the quantity ingested, the inherent toxicity of 
the poison and the time since ingestion. Gastric emptying 
is clearly unnecessary if the risk of toxicity is small or if the 
patient presents too late. Emptying the stomach may be of 
value if undertaken within 1-2 h after ingestion. The main 
83
NFI-2011
Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning
risk is with inhalation of stomach contents and gastric lavage 
should not be undertaken in drowsy or comatose patients 
without assistance of an anaesthetist so that the airway can 
be protected by a cuffed endotracheal tube. Gastric lavage 
must not be attempted after corrosive poisoning or for hydro-
carbon products which could be dangerous if aspirated.
Emesis:
Induction of emesis for the treatment of poisoning is not 
recommended. There is no evidence that it prevents absorp-
tion of the poison and it may increase the likelihood of aspira-
tion. Furthermore, the effects of the emetic substance may 
complicate diagnosis.
Prevention of Absorption:
Given by mouth activated charcoal can bind many poisons in 
the gastrointestinal system, thereby reducing their absorp-
tion. The sooner it is given, the more effective it is, but it may 
be effective for up to 1 hour after ingestion of the poison. It 
may be effective several hour after poisoning with modified-
release preparations or drugs with anticholinergic (antimus-
carinic) properties. It is relatively safe and particularly useful 
for prevention of absorption of poisons which are toxic in 
small amounts, for example, antidepressants. Furthermore, 
repeated doses of activated charcoal enhance the faecal 
elimination of some drugs (that undergo enterohepatic or 
enteroenteric recycling) several hours after ingestion and 
after they have been absorbed, for example phenobarbital, 
theophylline.

7.2 Specific
Paracetamol Overdosage:
Paracetamol in a dose of 10-15g or 150 mg/kg of paracetamol 
taken within 24 h may cause severe hepatocellular necrosis 
and less frequently renal tubular necrosis. The only early 
features of poisoning, nausea and vomiting, usually settle 
within 24 h. Persistence beyond this time, often with the 
onset of right subcostal pain and tenderness, usually indicates 
the development of liver damage which is maximal 3-4 days 
after ingestion. In spite of a lack of significant early symptoms, 
patients who have taken an overdose of paracetamol should 
be transferred to hospital urgently.
Administration of activated charcoal should be considered 
if paracetamol in excess of 150 mg/kg or 12g, whichever is 
smaller, is thought to have been ingested within the previous 
hour.
N-Acetylcysteine or N-methionine protect the liver if given 
within 10-12 h of ingesting paracetamol. Acetylcysteine, given 
intravenously is most effective within 8 h of overdosage, but 
is effective for up to and possibly beyond 24 h. Alternatively, 
methionine may be given by mouth provided the overdose 
was ingested within 10-12 h and the patient is not vomiting. 
However, acetylcysteine is the preferred treatment. Concur-
rent use of activated charcoal and specific oral antidotes 
should be avoided.
In remote areas methionine should be given, since adminis-
tration of acetylcysteine outside hospital is not generally prac-
ticable. Once the patient is in hospital the need to continue 
antidote treatment can be assessed from plasma-paracetamol 
concentrations.
Opioid Analgesic Overdosage:
Opioids cause varying degrees of coma, respiratory depression 
and pinpoint pupils. Naloxone is a specific antidote indicated if 
there is coma or bradypnoea. Naloxone has a shorter duration 
of action than many opioids so close monitoring and repeated 
injections are required depending on respiratory rate and depth 
of coma; naloxone may alternatively be given by intravenous 
infusion. The effects of some opioids such as buprenorphine 
are only partially reversed by naloxone.
Acute withdrawal syndromes may be precipitated by the use 
of naloxone in patients with a physical dependence on opioids 
or in overdosage with large doses; a withdrawal syndrome 
may occur in neonates of opioid-dependent mothers.
87
NFI-2011
Antidotes and Substances Used in Poisoning
Organophosphate and Carbamate Poisoning:
Organophosphates are absorbed through the bronchi and 
intact skin as well as from the gastrointestinal tract. Initial 
treatment of organophosphate or carbamate poisoning 
includes prevention of further absorption by emptying the 
stomach by gastric lavage, moving patient to fresh air supply, 
removing contaminated clothing and washing contaminated 
skin. A clear airway must be maintained.
Organophosphates inhibit cholinesterases and thus prolong 
the effects of acetylcholine. Toxicity depends on the particular 
compound involved and onset after ingestion, skin exposure 
may be delayed. Atropine will reverse the muscarinic effects 
of acetylcholine and is used (in conjunction with oximes such 
as pralidoxime) with additional symptomatic treatment.
Additional treatment for carbamate poisoning is generally symp-
tomatic and supportive. Atropine may be given but may not be 
required because of the rapidly reversible type of cholineste-
rase inhibition produced (oximes should not be given).
Iron Poisoning and Iron and Aluminium Overload:
Mortality from iron poisoning is reduced by specific therapy 
with desferrioxamine which chelates iron. Before administra-
tion of desferrioxamine the stomach should be emptied by 
gastric lavage (with a wide-bore tube) within 1 h of ingesting a 
significant quantity of iron or if radiography reveals tablets in 
the stomach. Desferrioxamine is also used to diagnose and treat 
chronic iron overload. It is used in the diagnosis of aluminium 
overload and to treat aluminium overload in patients with end-
stage renal failure undergoing maintenance haemodialysis.
Heavy Metal Poisoning:
Heavy metal poisoning may be treated with a range of anti-
dotes including dimercaprol, penicillamine, potassium ferric 
hexacyanoferrate and Sodium calcium edetate. Penicillamine is 
also used to promote excretion of copper in Wilson’s disease.
Methaemoglobinaemia:
Methylthioninium chloride can lower the levels of methae-
moglobin in red blood cells and is used in the treatment of 
methaemoglobinaemia. In large doses, it may cause methae-
moglobinaemia and therefore methaemoglobin levels should 
be monitored during treatment.
Cyanide Poisoning:
Cyanide poisoning may be treated with Sodium nitrite followed 
by Sodium thiosulphate.

8. Antiemetics
Antiemetics are drugs effective against nausea and vomiting. 
They are typically used to treat motion sickness and the side 
effects of opioid analgesics, general anaesthetics and chemo-
therapy induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients either 
alone or in combination. 
They act on the brain by preventing the stimulation of the 
vomiting centre (chemoreceptor trigger zone-CTZ). Some 
medications act on the gut by speeding up the rate at which 
the stomach empties and help to facilitate the quick transit of 
food through intestine (prokinetic action).
Classification:
5-HT
•	
3 receptor antagonists block serotonin receptors 
in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal 
tract: Ondansetron, Granisetron, Dolasetron etc. 
•	
Dopamine D2-receptor antagonists act in the brain: 
Domperidone, Metoclopramide, Mosapride etc.
Antihistamines or H
•	
1- histamine receptor antagonists: 
Diphenhydramine, Promethazine etc.
Benzodiazepines: 
•	
Midazolam, Lorazepam etc. 
Anticholinergics: Scopolamine, Hyoscine, 
•	
Dicyclomine 
etc.
Steroids: 
•	
Dexamethasone etc.
Metoclopramide has antiemetic properties and also stimu-
lates upper gastrointestinal motility. It is effective against 
nausea and vomiting associated with gastrointestinal disor-
ders or migraine, following surgery and chemotherapy and is 
also effective against radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. 
Combining metoclopramide with corticosteroids (such as 
dexamethasone) can improve its antiemetic effect in chemo-
therapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Metoclopramide may 
be useful in the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux 
and gastroparesis, as well as preoperatively in the prevention 
of aspiration syndromes. It is also used to facilitate intubation 
of the small bowel during radiographic examinations. It is not 
effective in the prevention or treatment of motion sickness.
Metoclopramide may cause acute dystonic reactions with facial 
and skeletal muscle spasms and oculogyric crisis. These reac-
tions are most common in the young (especially girls and young 
women) and the elderly; they occur shortly after the start of 
treatment and subside within 24 h of drug withdrawal.
Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative. In addition to D2

dopaminergic blockade it has pronounced histamine H1 and 
muscarinic receptor blocking properties. It is effective in the 
prevention and treatment of vertigo and motion sickness. 
Promethazine may be useful in the prevention and treatment 
of postoperative and drug-induced nausea and vomiting. It 
has limited effect on chemotherapy-induced mild to moderate 
emesis.

9.1 Antiamoebic, Antigiardiasis and 
Antitrichomoniasis Drugs
Amoebiasis:
Amoebic dysentery is caused by Entamoeba histolytica. It is 
transmitted by the faeco-oral route and infection is usually 
caused by ingestion of cysts from contaminated food and 
drink. Asymptomatic carriers are common in endemic areas. 
In non-endemic areas, sympto mless carriers should be 
treated with a luminal amoebicide which will reduce the risk 
of transmission and protect the patient from invasive amoe-
biasis. Diloxanide furoate is most widely used, but other 
compounds, including clefamide, etofamide and teclozan, 
are also effective. Treatment with diloxanide furoate is 
regarded as successful if stools are free of E. histolytica for 
one month. Several specimens should be examined in evalu-
ating response to treatment.
Symptomatic (invasive) amoebiasis may be classified as 
intestinal or extra-intestinal. Intestinal amoebiasis is either 
amoebic dysentery or non-dysenteric amoebic colitis. Extra-
intestinal amoebiasis most commonly involves the liver, but 
may involve the skin, genito-urinary tract, lung and brain. 
Invasive amoebiasis is more likely in malnutrition, immu-
nosuppression and pregnancy. Amoebic dysentery may 
take a fulminating course in late pregnancy and the puer-
perium; treatment with metronidazole may be life saving. 
In less severe infection, metronidazole should, if possible, 
be avoided in the first trimester. All patients with invasive 
amoebiasis require treatment with a systemically active 
compound such as metronidazole, ornidazole and tinidazole 
followed by a luminal amoebicide in order to eliminate any 
surviving organisms in the colon. Combined preparations are 
useful. In severe cases of amoebic dysentery, tetracycline 
given in combination with a systemic amoebicide lessens the 
risk of superinfection, intestinal perforation and peritonitis. 
Hepatic abscesses should be lanced by needle aspiration.
Giardiasis:
Giardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis and is acquired by 
oral ingestion of Giardia cysts. Giardiasis can be treated with 
tinidazole in a single dose or with another 5-nitroimidazole 
106
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
such as metronidazole ; both are highly effective and should 
be offered when practicable to all infected patients. Family 
and institutional contacts should also be treated. Larger 
epidemics are difficult to eradicate because of the high 
proportion of sympto mless carriers and because excreted 
cysts can survive for long periods outside the human host.
Trichomoniasis:
Trichomoniasis is an infection of the genito-urinary tract 
caused by Trichomonas vaginalis and transmission is usually 
sexual. In women it causes vaginitis although some are 
asymptomatic. It is usually asymptomatic in men but may 
cause urethritis. Patients and their sexual partners should be 
treated with metronidazole or other nitroimidazole.

9.2 Antibacterial Drugs
Beta-Lactams:
Beta-lactam antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins 
and carbapenems share a common structure; they are 
bactericidal, their mechanism of action resulting from inhibi-
tion of peptidoglycan, a mucopeptide in bacterial cell walls. 
Benzylpenicillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin are active 
against susceptible strains of Gram-positive bacteria and 
Gram-negative bacteria, spirochaetes and actinomycetes, but 
are inactivated by penicillinase and other beta-lactamases. 
Benzathine benzylpenicillin and procaine benzylpenicillin are 
long-acting preparations which slowly release benzylpenicillin 
on injection. A range of penicillins with improved stability 
to gastric acid and penicillinases have been produced by 
substitution of the 6-amino position of 6-aminopenicillanic 
acid. Cloxacillin is an isoxazoyl penicillin which is resistant to 
staphylococcal penicillinase. Broad-spectrum penicillins such 
as ampicillin are acid-stable and active against Gram-positive 
and Gram-negative bacteria, but are inactivated by penicil-
linase. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanic acid are 
often necessary to provide activity against beta-lactamases 
produced by a wide range of both Gram-negative and Gram-
positive bacteria.
Cephalosporins are classified by generation, with the first 
generation agents having Gram-positive and some Gram-
negative activity; the second generation drugs have improved 
Gram-negative activity and the third generation cephalosporin 
have a wider spectrum of activity, although may be less active 
against Gram-positive bacteria than first generation drugs, 
but they are active against Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Carbapenems are semisynthetic derivatives of Streptomyces 
cattleya. They have a broad spectrum of activity and are 
stable to most penicillinases. They should be reserved for 
severe infections resistant to other antibiotics.
Penicillins may cause encephalopathy due to cerebral irritation. 
This rare, but serious adverse effect may result from very high 
doses or in severe renal failure. Penicillins should not be given 
by intrathecal injection because they can cause encephalopathy 
which may be fatal.
Hypersensitivity:
The most important adverse effect of penicillins is hypersensi-
tivity which causes rashes and, occasionally anaphylaxis, which 
can be fatal. A careful history should be taken with regard to 
110
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
previous allergic reactions. If rash develops, another antimicro-
bial should be substituted. Allergic reactions to penicillins occur 
in 1-10% of exposed individuals, while anaphylactic reactions 
occur in fewer than 0.05% of treated patients. Individuals with a 
history of anaphylaxis, urticaria or rash immediately after peni-
cllin administration are at risk of immediate hypersensitivity to 
penicillin. These individuals should not receive penicillin, rather a 
cephalosporins  or another beta-lactam antibiotic may be used. 
Patients who are allergic to one penicillin will be allergic to them 
all because the hypersensitivity is related to the basic penicillin 
structure and about 10% of penicillin-sensitive patients will be 
allergic to cephalosporins  and other beta-lactams. Individuals 
with a history of a minor rash (a non-confluent rash restricted 
to a small area of the body) or a rash occurring more than 72 h 
after penicillin administration are possibly not allergic to peni-
cillin and in these individuals a penicillin should not be withheld 
unnecessarily for a serious infection; however, the possibility of 
an allergic reaction should be borne in mind and facilities should 
be available for treating anaphylaxis.
Ampicillin, Amoxycillin, Amoxycillin with Clavulanic 
Acid and Cloxacillin:
Ampicillin is active against certain Gram-positive and Gram-
negative organisms. It is used to treat a wide range of infec-
tions including otitis media, respiratory-tract and urinary-
tract infections and gonorrhoea due to susceptible bacteria. 
However, ampicillin is inactivated by penicillinases including 
those produced by Staphylococcus aureus and by common 
Gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli; many strains 
of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae and Salmonella and Shigella spp. are resistant. 
There are geographical variations in the incidence of resistance 
and an awareness of local patterns is important. In some areas, 
oral use should be restricted to treatment of Shigella infections; 
it is given in an oral dose of 1g every 6 h for 7-10 days.
Amoxycillin has a similar spectrum of activity to ampicillin, 
but is also inactivated by penicillinases. However, it is better 
absorbed after oral administration than ampicillin and higher 
plasma and tissue levels are achieved. Amoxycillin is preferred 
to ampicillin for the treatment of some infections including 
otitis media and respiratory-tract and urinary-tract infections.
Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. It has no signifi-
cant antibacterial activity but in combination with Amoxycillin 
widens Amoxycillin’s spectrum of activity and allows its use 
against Amoxycillin-resistant strains of bacteria. It is used in 
respiratory-tract, genito-urinary and abdominal infections, 
cellulitis, animal bites and dental infections.
111
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
Cloxacillin is used to treat infections due to penicillinase-pro-
ducing staphylococci which are resistant to benzylpenicillin. It 
is acid-stable and may therefore be given by mouth as well as 
by injection.
These antibiotics may also be administered with an aminogly-
coside to increase their spectrums of activity. The penicillin 
and aminoglycoside should not be mixed before or during 
administration, because loss of aminoglycoside activity can 
occur on mixing.
Benzylpenicillin and Phenoxymethylpenicillin:
Benzylpenicillin remains an important and useful antibiotic 
but it is inactivated by bacterial beta-lactamases. It is effective 
for many streptococcal (including pneumococcal), gonococcal 
and meningococcal infections and also for anthrax, diph-
theria, gas gangrene, leptospirosis, tetanus and treatment of 
Lyme disease in children. Pneumococci, meningococci and 
gonococci often have decreased sensitivity to penicillin and 
benzylpenicillin is no longer the first choice for pneumococcal 
meningitis. Benzylpenicillin is given by injection as it is inacti-
vated by gastric acid and absorption from the intestinal tract 
is low.
Depot preparations are used when therapeutic concentrations 
need to be sustained for several h. Benzathine benzylpeni-
cillin or procaine benzylpenicillin provides a tissue depot from 
which the drug is slowly absorbed over a period of 12 hour to 
several days. They are the preferred choice for the treatment 
of syphilis or yaws.
Phenoxymethylpenicillin is suitable for oral administration; 
it has a similar spectrum of activity but is less effective than 
benzylpenicillin. It should not be used for serious infections 
because absorption can be unpredictable and plasma concen-
trations variable.
Cephalosporins and Imipenem with Cilastatin:
Ceftazidime and ceftriaxone are third generation cefa-
losporins. Ceftriaxone is used for serious infections such as 
septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis; it is used as a reserve 
antimicrobial to treat meningitis due to Streptococcus pneu-
moniae in some areas where penicillin resistance is found. 
Ceftazidime is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
other Gram-negative bacteria; it is used in the treatment of 
pseudomonal infections and in some areas is restricted to use 
only where gentamicin resistance is high.
Imipenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. As it is partially 
112
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
inactivated by enzymatic activity in the kidney, it is adminis-
tered with cilastatin which inhibits the renal metabolism of 
imipenem. It is active against many aerobic and anaerobic 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; in some areas it is 
reserve agent for the treatment of infections due to Acineto-
bacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, which are resistant to other 
more usual treatments.
Quinolones:
Ciprofloxacin is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria. It is particularly active against salmonella, 
shigella, campylobacter, neisseria, Bacillus anthracis and 
pseudomonas. It is also active against chlamydia and some 
mycobacteria. Most anaerobic organisms are not susceptible. 
Ciprofloxacin is used with doxycycline and metronidazole to 
treat pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Nalidixic acid is an older quinolone effective in uncomplicated 
urinary-tract infections and, in the treatment of shigella in 
areas where it remains susceptible.
Tetracyclines:
Doxycycline is a tetracycline and is a broad-spectrum antibi-
otic effective for conditions caused by chlamydia, rickettsia, 
brucella and the spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme 
disease). It is the preferred tetracycline since it has a more 
favourable pharmacokinetic profile than tetracycline. It is 
deposited in growing bone and teeth causing staining and 
occasionally dental hypoplasia. It should not be given to chil-
dren under 8 years or pregnant women; in some countries, 
use in children under 12 years is contraindicated.
Aminoglycosides:
Aminoglycosides including gentamicin are bactericidal and 
active against some Gram-positive and many Gram-negative 
organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Aminoglyco-
sides are not absorbed from the gut and must therefore be 
given by injection for systemic infections. Excretion is mainly 
by the kidney and accumulation occurs in renal impairment.
Use of gentamicin should be restricted to trained health 
personnel and care must be taken to ensure correct dosage 
and duration of treatment are not exceeded, because most 
adverse effects are dose related. The most important adverse 
effects are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity and they are most 
common in the elderly and in patients with renal impairment. 
These groups and, if possible, all patients should be monitored 
for ototoxicity by audiometry. If there is impairment of renal 
function the dose interval must be increased; in severe renal 
impairment, the dose should also be reduced. Serum concen-
113
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
tration monitoring avoids both excessive and subtherapeutic 
concentrations and can prevent toxicity and ensure efficacy. 
If possible serum concentrations should be monitored in all 
patients, but must be measured in infants, the elderly, in 
obesity, in cystic fibrosis, in high-dosage regimens, in renal 
impairment, or if treatment lasts for longer than 7 days.
For most infections, doses of up to 5 mg/kg daily in divided 
doses are used if renal function is normal; higher doses are 
used occasionally for serious infections. Loading and mainte-
nance doses are based on the patient’s weight and renal func-
tion (for example, using a nomogram) with adjustments based 
on plasma gentamicin concentration.
Chloramphenicol:
Chloramphenicol is a potent broad-spectrum antibiotic. It 
is associated with serious haematological adverse effects 
and should be reserved for the treatment of severe infec-
tions, particularly those caused by Haemophilus influenzae 
and typhoid fever. The oily suspension should be reserved 
for use in situations of catastrophic epidemics of meningo-
coccal meningitis occurring mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, 
during which the medical services are overwhelmed by 
the epidemic and in which the overwhelming scale of 
the epidemic precludes any other form of antimicrobial 
therapy.
Macrolides:
Erythromycin is a macrolide; it has an antibacterial spec-
trum that is similar but not identical to penicillin and is 
used as an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients. It is 
effective in respiratory infections, whooping cough, legion-
naires’ disease and campylobacter enteritis.
Azithromycin is more active than erythromycin against some 
Gram-negative organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis. The 
concentration and persistance of azithromycin is much higher 
in the tissue than in plasma; a single dose of azithromycin is 
used in the treatment of uncomplicated genital chlamydia 
and trachoma. Azithromycin is not recommended if there 
is a possibility of gonorrhoea because macrolide resistance 
emerges rapidly when it is used in this setting.
Metronidazole:
Metronidazole has high activity against anaerobic bacteria 
and protozoa. Metronidazole by the rectal route is an effective 
alternative to the intravenous route when oral administration 
is not possible.
114
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
Nitrofurantoin:
Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal in vitro to most Gram-positive 
and Gram-negative urinary-tract pathogens and it is used to 
treat acute and recurrent urinary-tract infections. It is also 
used prophylactically in chronic urinary-tract infections. 
Sulfonamides and Trimethoprim:
The usefulness of sulfonamides is limited by an increasing 
incidence of bacterial resistance. For many indications they 
have been replaced by antibiotics that are more active and 
safer. Sulfadiazine is used in the prevention of rheumatic 
fever recurrence. Sulfamethoxazole is used in combination 
with trimethoprim because of their synergistic activity. In 
some countries, indications for the use of this combination 
have been restricted. The treatment of Pneumocystis carinii 
infections must only be undertaken with specialist supervision 
where there are appropriate monitoring facilities. Trimetho-
prim is also used alone for respiratory-tract infections and, in 
particular, for urinary-tract infections.
Vancomycin:
Vancomycin is not significantly absorbed from the gastroin-
testinal tract and must be given intravenously for systemic 
infections which cannot be treated with other effective, less 
toxic antimicrobials. It is used to treat serious infections due 
to Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphy-
lococcal infections, brain abscess, staphylococcal meningitis 
and septicaemia.

that predispose to seizures, G-6-PD 
deficiency, myasthenia gravis (risk of 
exacerbation), 
pregnancy 
(Appendix 
7c), lactation (Appendix 7b), children or 
adolescents (see below); avoid exposure 
to excessive sunlight (discontinue if 
photosensitivity occurs); rarely, tendon 
damage-discontinue at first sign of 
pain or inflammation and rest affected 
limb; hepatic impairment; renal failure 
(Appendix 7d); avoid excessive alkalinity 
of urine and ensure adequate fluid intake 
as there is risk of crystalluria; interactions 
(Appendix 6c); cerebral arteriosclerosis, 
anxiety, paranoia, erythema, blistering.
Use In Children. Ciprofloxacin causes 
arthropathy in the weight-bearing joints of 
immature animals and is therefore generally 
not recommended in children and growing 
adolescents. However, the significance of 
this effect in humans is uncertain and in 
some specific circumstances short-term use 
of ciprofloxacin in children may be justified. 
Ciprofloxacin is used for pseudomonal 
infections in cystic fibrosis (for children over 
5 years) and for treatment and prophylaxis 
of anthrax.
May impair ability to perform skilled tasks, 
for example operating machinery, driving.

9.3 Antifilarial Drugs
Loiasis:
Loiasis is an infection with the filarial nematode Loa loa and is 
transmitted by the biting of tabanid fly Chrysops. Diethylcar-
bamazine is effective against both adult worms and larvae; a 
single weekly dose is normally effective as prophylaxis. During 
individual treatment, particularly of persons with heavy micro-
filaraemia (>50 000 microfilariae/ml blood), a condition simu-
lating meningoencephalitis occasionally occurs. This probably 
results from sludging of moribund microfilariae within cere-
bral capillaries. The frequency of meningoencephalitis associ-
ated with diethylcarbamazine therapy of loiasis is reported as 
1.25%, with a mortality rate of about 50% in affected patients; 
treatment with diethylcarbamazine should be stopped at the 
first sign of cerebral involvement (and specialist advice sought). 
Permanent cerebral damage is common among patients who 
survive and this possibility should be considered when deciding 
on treatment. Treatment of heavily infected patients should 
thus begin at low dosage and corticosteroid and antihistamine 
cover should be provided for the first 2 to 3 days.
Lymphatic Filariasis:
Lymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with Wuchereria 
bancrofti (bancroftian filariasis), Brugia malayi or B. timori 
(brugian filariasis). Occult filariasis (tropical pulmonary eosi-
nophilia) is a clinical variant of W. bancrofti infection. Indi-
vidual treatment with diethylcarbamazine which has both 
microfilaricidal and macrofilaricidal activity is effective. Total 
cumulative dosages of 72 mg/kg are generally recommended 
for Wuchereria bancrofti infections with half this dose used 
for Brugia malayi and B. timori infections. In all cases treat-
ment is best initiated with smaller doses for 2-3 days to avoid 
the danger of immunological reactions. Rigorous hygiene 
to the affected limbs with adjunctive measures to minimize 
infection and promote lymph flow is important for reducing 
acute episodes of inflammation.
In communities where filariasis is endemic, annual administra-
tion of single doses of albendazole 400 mg with either diethyl-
carbamazine (6 mg/kg) or ivermectin (200 µg/kg) is effective 
for interrupting transmission; this treatment is continued for 
at least 5 years. Trials in India and China have shown that the 
consistent use for 6-12 months of table salt containing diethyl-
carbamazine 0.1% can eliminate W. bancrofti; a concentration 
of 0.3% for 3-4 months may be required where B. malayi is 
endemic.

9.4 Antifungal Drugs
Fungal infections can be superficial or systemic. Superfi-
cial infections affect only the skin, hair, nails or mucous 
membranes whereas systemic fungal infections affect the 
body as a whole.
Systemic fungal infections are sometimes caused by inhala-
tion, ingestion or inoculation of primary pathogens and some-
times by opportunistic invasion of commensals in patients 
with lowered host resistance. They are increasing in preva-
lence not only because of the pandemic of HIV infection, but 
also because of the rise in illicit intravenous drug use in many 
countries and greater use of broad spectrum antibiotics and 
invasive medical procedures. In immunodeficient patients 
systemic fungal infections are often disseminated.
Amphotericin B is a lipophilic polyene antibiotic; it is fungi-
static against a broad spectrum of pathogenic fungi, including 
Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, 
Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidi-
oides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Mucor, Absidia 
and Phicopes spp.; it is active against algal Prototheca spp. and 
against the Leishmania protozoa. It is used for the empirical 
treatment of serious fungal infections and is used in conjunc-
tion with flucytosine to treat cryptococcal meningitis and 
systemic candidosis.
Amphotericin B has to be administered parenterally as there is 
little or no absorption from the gastrointestinal tract; ampho-
tericin B is liable to cause nephrotoxicity. Duration of therapy 
varies with the initial severity of the infection and the clinical 
response of the patient. In some infections a satisfactory 
response is only obtained after several months of continuous 
treatment. Intrathecal infusion has been used successfully in 
patients with meningeal coccidioidomycosis.
Fluconazole an orally active synthetic imidazole derivative, 
possesses fungistatic activity against dermatophytes, yeasts 
and other pathogenic fungi. It is widely used in the treatment 
of serious gastrointestinal and systemic mycoses as well as in 
the management of superficial infections. Fluconazole is also 
used to prevent fungal infections in immunocompromised 
patients. 
Flucytosine, is a synthetic fluorinated pyrimidine with a 
narrow spectrum of antifungal activity, particularly against 
Cryptococcus and Candida spp. In susceptible fungi, it is 
converted to 5-fluorouracil by cytosine deaminase. Flucyto-
sine is myelosuppressive and plasma concentrations above 
75 µg/ml are associated with myelotoxicity.
156
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
Griseofulvin is a fungistatic antibiotic derived from Penicil-
lium griseofulvum with selective activity against the dermato-
phytes causing ringworm, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton 
rubrum and T. verrucosum. It has no activity against pityriasis 
versicolor or candida infections. Griseofulvin is deposited 
selectively in keratin precursor cells of skin, hair and nails 
where it disrupts the mitotic apparatus of fungal cells thus 
preventing fungal invasion of newly-formed cells. It is unsuit-
able for prophylactic use. Close attention should be given to 
hygiene and to possible reservoirs of reinfection in clothing, 
footware and bedding. 
Nystatin, a polyene antifungal antibiotic derived from Strepto-
myces noursei, is effective against infections caused by a wide 
range of yeasts and yeast-like fungi. It is poorly absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract and it is not absorbed from the skin 
or mucous membranes when applied topically. It is used for 
the prophylaxis and treatment of candidosis.
Potassium iodide aqueous oral solution is a clear liquid 
with a characteristic, strong salty taste. It is effective against 
sporotrichosis and subcutaneous phycomycosis, which are 
fungal infections caused by Sporothrix schenckii and Basidi-
obolus haptosporus respectively. In subcutaneous sporotri-
chosis, amphotericin B is often effective in patients unable 
to tolerate iodides. Itraconazole, by mouth has been tried 
as an alternative to potassium iodide in both cutaneous and 
extracutaneous sporotrichosis. In phycomycosis, fluconazole 
may be effective.

9.5 Anthelminthics
Cestode Infections:
Cestode infections (tapeworms) include intestinal taeniasis 
and cysticercosis, hymenolepiasis (dwarf tapeworm), diphyllo-
bothriasis and echinococcosis (hydatid disease). Cysticercosis 
is a systemic infection caused by the larval form (cysticercus) 
of Taenia solium.
Neurocysticercosis occurs when the infection involves the 
brain. In man, echinococcosis is due to the larval stage of Echi-
nococcus granulosus or E. multilocularis. The larvae (onco-
spheres) develop by expansion (cystic echinococcosis) or 
tumour-like infiltration (alveolar echinococcosis), respectively, 
in the liver, lungs, or other organs.
1. Diphyllobothriasis:
In diphyllobothriasis, niclosamide or praziquantel in a single 
dose is highly effective. Hydroxocobalamin and folic acid 
supplements may also be required.
2. Echinococcosis:
In echinococcosis, surgery (or, if this is not possible, a tech-
nique such as ‘puncture-aspiration-injection-reaspiration’) 
is the treatment of choice for operable cystic disease due to 
Echinococcus granulosus but chemotherapy with benzimida-
zoles, such as mebendazole and albendazole, may be of value 
as adjunctive therapy. Alveolar echinococcosis due to E. multi-
locularis requires both surgery and long-term treatment with 
either mebendazole or albendazole to inhibit spread of the 
infection.
In animal studies, albendazole and mebendazole have been 
found to be teratogenic. They are contraindicated for the treat-
ment of cestode infections in pregnancy; pregnancy should be 
excluded before treatment with albendazole (non-hormonal 
contraception during and for 1 month after treatment). For 
single-dose or short-term use in pregnancy.
3. Hymenolepiasis:
In hymenolepiasis, praziquantel is more effective than niclosa-
mide, although resistance to praziquantel has been reported. 
Repeated treatment may be necessary to cure intense infec-
tions or to eliminate the parasite within a family group or 
institution.
4. Taeniasis:
In taeniasis, praziquantel is well tolerated and extensively 
absorbed and kills adult intestinal taenia worms in a single 
165
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
dose. Praziquantel also kills T. solium cysticerci when taken for 
14 days in high doses. It thus offers the prospect of a cure for 
neurocysticercosis, which has been treatable only by surgery, 
anti-inflammatory 
corticosteroids 
and 
anticonvulsants. 
However, because dying and disintegrating cysts may induce 
localized cerebral oedema, treatment with praziquantel 
must always be undertaken in a hospital setting. In addition, 
a corticosteroid is usually given to reduce the inflammatory 
response. Albendazole also kills neurocysticerci when given 
daily for one month; a corticosteroid or an antihistamine is 
also given to reduce any inflammatory reaction. The longer-
established niclosamide acts only against the adult intestinal 
worms. Cestode infections due to T. solium, occurring during 
pregnancy should always be treated immediately (with prazi-
quantel or niclosamide, but not with albendazole) because of 
the risk of cysticercosis.
Intestinal Nematode Infections:
Intestinal nematode infections include ascariasis, capillariasis, 
enterobiasis, hookworm infection, strongyloidiasis, trichos-
trongyliasis and trichuriasis.
1. Ascariasis:
Ascariasis is an infection, usually of the small intestine, caused 
by Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm). Single doses of levami-
sole or pyrantel are effective; the broad-spectrum anthelmin-
thics, albendazole or mebendazole are also effective.
2. Capillariasis:
Capillariasis is caused by infection of the intestine with Capil-
laria philippinensis. Prolonged treatment with mebendazole 
or albendazole offers the only prospect of cure.
3. Enterobiasis:
Enterobiasis is an infection of the large intestine caused by 
Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm, threadworm). All household 
members should be treated concurrently with a single dose of 
mebendazole, albendazole or pyrantel. Since reinfection readily 
occurs, at least one further dose should be given 2-4 weeks 
later. Piperazine is also effective but must be taken regularly for 
at least 7 consecutive days.
4. Hookworm Infections:
Hookworm infections are caused by Ancylostoma duodenale 
(ancylostomiasis) and Necator americanus (necatoriasis); they 
are a major cause of iron-deficiency anaemia in the tropics 
and sub-tropics. Ideally all cases of hookworm infection should 
be treated. However, when this is impracticable, priority 
should be given to women in second- and third-trimester of 
166
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
pregnancy, children and debilitated patients. In hookworm, 
broad-spectrum anthelminthics are preferred wherever other 
nematode infections are endemic. Both mebendazole and 
albendazole are effective.
In animal studies, albendazole and mebendazole have been 
found to be teratogenic. There is some evidence to suggest 
that the use of mebendazole in pregnancy is not associated 
with an increased incidence of adverse effects on the fetus. 
However, neither mebendazole nor albendazole should be 
used during the first trimester of pregnancy to treat nema-
tode infections. Both drugs are contraindicated for the treat-
ment of cestode infections in pregnancy.
Levamisole is effective in the treatment of mixed Ascaris and 
hookworm infections and pyrantel has been highly effective 
in some community-based control programmes, although 
several doses are often needed to eliminate Necator ameri-
canus infection. Patients with iron-deficiency anaemia caused 
by hookworm infection require supplementary iron salts and 
should receive ferrous sulphate (200 mg daily for adults) for 
at least 3 months after the haemoglobin concentration of 
12g/100 ml is obtained.
5. Strongyloidiasis:
Strongyloidiasis is an infection of the small intestine caused 
by Strongyloides stercoralis. All infected patients should be 
treated. Ivermectin in a single dose of 200 µg/kg or 200 µg/
kg/day on two consecutive days is the treatment of choice for 
chronic strongyloidiasis but it may not be available in all coun-
tries. Albendazole 400 mg once or twice daily for 3 days is well 
tolerated by both adults and children aged over 2 years and it 
may eradicate up to 80% of infections. Mebendazole has also 
been used but, to be effective, it must be administered for 
longer periods as it has a limited effect on larvae and hence the 
prevention of autoinfection.
6. Trichostrongyliasis:
Trichostrongyliasis is an infection of the small intestine caused 
by Trichostrongylus spp. In symptomatic trichostrongyliasis, a 
single dose of pyrantel (10 mg/kg) or albendazole (400 mg) is 
effective.
7. Trichuriasis:
Trichuriasis is an infection of the large intestine caused by 
Trichuris trichiura (whipworm). Chemotherapy is required 
whenever symptoms develop or when faecal samples are found 
to be heavily contaminated (up to 10,000 eggs per gram). A 
single dose of albendazole (400 mg) or mebendazole (500 mg) 
can be effective in mild to moderate infections; severe infec-
167
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
tions require a 3-day course.
Tissue Nematode Infections:
Tissue nematode infections include angiostrongyliasis, anisaki-
asis, cutaneous larva migrans, dracunculiasis, trichinellosis and 
visceral larva migrans.
1. Angiostrongyliasis:
Angiostrongyliasis is caused by infection with the larvae of the 
rat lungworm, Parastrongylus cantonensis (Angiostrongylus 
cantonensis). Symptomatic treatment pending spontaneous 
recovery is often all that is required.
2. Anisakiasis:
Anisakiasis is caused by infection with seafood containing 
larvae of Anisakis, Contracaecum or Pseudoterranova spp. 
In anisakiasis, anthelminthic treatment is rarely, necessary. 
Prevention is dependent upon informing communities of the 
hazards of eating raw or inadequately prepared salt-water 
fish; and early evisceration of fish after capture and freezing 
of seafood at -20⁰C for at least 60 h before sale.
3. Cutaneous Larva Migrans:
Cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption) is caused by 
infection with larvae of animal hookworms, usually Ancylos-
toma braziliense and A. caninum which infect cats and dogs. 
Albendazole in a single dose of 400 mg is effective.
4. Dracunculiasis:
Dracunculiasis (dracontiasis, guinea-worm infection) is caused 
by infection with Dracunculus medinensis, acquired through 
drinking water containing larvae that develop in small fresh-
water crustaceans. Metronidazole (25 mg/kg daily for 10 days, 
with a daily max. of 750 mg for children) provides rapid symp-
tomatic relief. It also weakens the anchorage of the worms 
in the subcutaneous tissues and they can then be removed 
by traction. However, since it has no effect on the larvae of 
pre-emergent worms, it does not immediately prevent trans-
mission.
5. Trichinellosis:
Trichinellosis (trichinosis) is caused by infection with the 
larvae of Trichinella spiralis. Each case of confirmed or even 
suspected trichinellosis infection should be treated in order 
to prevent the continued production of larvae. In both adults 
and children, mebendazole (200 mg daily for 5 days), albenda-
zole (400 mg daily for 3 days) and pyrantel (10 mg/kg daily for 
5 days) are all effective. Prednisolone (40-60 mg daily) may be 
needed to alleviate the allergic and inflammatory symptoms.
168
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
6. Visceral Larva Migrans:
Visceral larva migrans (toxocariasis) is caused by infection with 
the larval forms of Toxocara canis and less commonly, T. cati 
(which infect dogs and cats). Treatment should be reserved 
for symptomatic infections. A 3 week oral course of diethyl-
carbamazine kills the larvae and arrests the disease, but 
established lesions are irreversible. To reduce the intensity of 
allergic reactions induced by dying larvae, dosage is commonly 
commenced at 1 mg/kg twice daily and raised progressively to 
3 mg/kg twice daily (adults and children).
Ocular larva migrans occurs when larvae invade the eye, 
causing a granuloma which may result in blindness. In order 
to suppress allergic inflammatory responses in patients with 
ophthalmic lesions, prednisolone should be administered 
concurrently, either topically or systemically.

9.6 Anti-Leishmaniasis Drugs
Leishmaniasis is caused by the parasitic protozoa Leishmania. It 
can be categorized as visceral, cutaneous or mucocutaneous. It 
may be a self-limiting localized skin lesion but may range from 
this to disseminated progressive disease. In endemic areas 
there is usually a reservoir of disease in a mammalian host and 
the usual vectors are sandflies. 
Visceral Leishmaniasis:
Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) is caused by Leishmania 
donovani and L. infantum (Old World) and by L. chagasi (New 
World) and it is usually responsive initially to the pentavalent 
antimony compounds, meglumine antimoniate or Sodium 
stibogluconate. Both dosage and duration of treatment need 
to be adjusted according to the clinical response. Patients 
are considered to be clinically cured when no parasites are 
detected in splenic or bone marrow aspirates. However, 
biopsies should be repeated after 3 and 12 months since 
relapse is frequent. Antimonials combined with allopurinol, 
pentamidine isothionate and amphotericin B have been 
used with success in patients in relapse who have become 
unresponsive to antimonials alone.
Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:
Cutaneous leishmaniasis comprises two conditions. The Old 
World variety is caused by L. tropica, L. major, L. infantum 
and L. aethiopica. The New World variety is caused by L. 
amazonensis, L. mexicana, L. peruviana, L. guyanensis, L. 
panamensis and L. braziliensis. These conditions are charac-
terized by a cell-mediated reaction of varying intensity at the 
site of inoculation. The New World variety tends to be more 
severe and slower to heal. Infections caused by L. major, L. 
mexicana, L. tropica and L. peruviana, are responsive to intral-
esional injections of antimonial compounds. Mild lesions 
can often be left to heal spontaneously. However, it is pref-
erable to treat L. tropica infections with a view to reducing 
transmission since humans seem to be the only host. When 
the lesion is inflamed or ulcerated or when obstruction of 
lymphatic drainage or destruction of cartilage creates a risk 
of serious disfigurement or disability, antimonials should be 
administered systemically as well as locally. Infections due 
to L. braziliensis and the less common L. panamensis should 
be treated with antimonials because of the risk of mucosal 
involvement. L. aethiopica is less responsive at conventional 
doses and the sores should be left to heal spontaneously if 
there is no evidence of diffuse cutaneous involvement. L. 
172
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
guyanensis infections should be treated with pentamidine
Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis:
Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by L. braziliensis 
and L. panamensis. In this form of the disease the primary 
lesions do not heal and spread to the mucosa may occur. It 
usually responds to antimonials and, when relapses occur, 
more extended courses of treatment are often successful. 
Patients who still fail to respond should receive amphotericin 
B or pentamidine isothionate, although neither treatment 
is highly satisfactory. Because of resistance to antimonials, 
L. aethiopica infections should be treated with pentamidine 
from the outset until complete healing occurs.
Emergency use of corticosteroids may be needed to control 
pharyngeal or tracheal oedema produced by severe inflam-
mation resulting from antigens liberated from dead parasites 
during the early phase of treatment.
Antibiotics may also be needed to treat secondary infections 
and plastic surgery offers the only means of ameliorating disfig-
uring scars.
Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:
Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis usually occurs following infec-
tion with L. amazonensis, L. aethiopica or L. mexicana and is 
usually treated with antimonial compounds, but relapses must 
be expected and repeated courses of pentamidine isothionate 
may be needed until clinical immunity is established.

9.7 Antimalarial Drugs
Human malaria, which is transmitted by female anopheline 
mosquitoes (and rarely, by congenital transmission, transfu-
sion of infected blood or use of contaminated syringes among 
drug addicts), is caused by four species of plasmodial para-
sites. Plasmodium vivax is the most extensively distributed 
and causes much debilitating disease. P. falciparum is also 
widespread and causes the most severe infections which 
are responsible for nearly all malaria-related deaths. P. ovale 
is mainly confined to Africa and is less prevalent, while P. 
malariae, which causes the least severe but most persistent 
infections, also occurs widely.
Certain tissue forms of P. vivax and P. ovale which persist in 
the liver for many months and even years are responsible 
for the relapses characteristic of malaria. Such latent forms 
are not generated by P. falciparum or P. malariae. Recrudes-
cence of these infections results from persistent blood forms 
in inadequately treated or untreated patients.
Treatment of Malaria:
Blood schizonticides, which suppress malaria by destroying the 
asexual blood forms of the parasites, are the mainstay of the 
treatment of acute malaria and some are used for prophylaxis. 
They include the 4-aminoquinolines (example amodiaquine 
and chloroquine), the related arylaminoalcohols (example 
mefloquine and quinine) and artemisinin and its derivatives 
(example artemether and artesunate). Blood schizonticides 
are not active against intrahepatic forms and therefore they 
do not eliminate infections by P. vivax and P. ovale.
Some antimetabolites act synergistically when given in combi-
nation. For example, pyrimethamine in combination with a 
sulfonamide (sulfadoxine) or sulfone and some antibiotics 
(for example doxycycline) are blood schizonticides. Because 
they act more slowly, these substances are of little value when 
used alone. The tetracyclines are used primarily as adjuncts to 
quinine where multiple-drug-resistant P. falciparum is preva-
lent. 
Chloroquine, a rapidly acting schizonticide, is well tolerated, 
safe and inexpensive. It should be used to treat malaria wher-
ever the parasites remain susceptible. P. malariae and P. ovale 
remain fully sensitive to chloroquine.
A 3-day course of chloroquine by mouth is sufficient to elimi-
nate susceptible P. falciparum infections because effective plas-
ma-chloroquine concentration is sustained for several weeks.
If subsequent relapse occurs in P. ovale and P. vivax infections 
primaquine should be administered, after a second course of 
chloroquine, to eliminate the intrahepatic infection.
176
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
Amodiaquine is an alternative to chloroquine for the treat-
ment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection; but cross-
resistance with chloroquine exists in some areas. It should 
preferably be used as part of combination therapy with other 
antimalarials, for example artesunate. Hepatitis and blood 
disorders were reported when amodiaquine was used for 
prophylaxis of malaria; patients should be told how to recog-
nise the symptoms of these conditions and advised to seek 
medical help if they occur.
The combination of sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine is recom-
mended for the treatment of malaria only in areas of high 
chloroquine resistance. A single dose of sulfadoxine with 
pyrimethamine is usually sufficient to eliminate infection; 
quinine should also be given for 3 days in patients in whom 
quinine may accelerate reduction of parasitaemia and in those 
at risk of fulminating disease. Because sulfonamides are asso-
ciated with a risk of haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia 
in the newborn, quinine is preferred to treat chloroquine-re-
sistant malaria during pregnancy.
Mefloquine is generally well tolerated, although, some adverse 
effects have been reported (see notes). However, because of 
the danger of the emergence of mefloquine-resistant strains 
of P. falciparum and because of its potential toxicity, it should 
be used only following either microscopic or careful clinical 
diagnosis of P. falciparum infections that are known or strongly 
suspected to be resistant to chloroquine or sulfadoxine with 
pyrimethamine.
Quinine, given orally, should be reserved for P. falciparum 
infections likely to be unresponsive to other drugs. Doxycy-
cline, which is an effective oral schizonticide, should be given 
in combination with quinine except in pregnant women and 
children under 8 years.
In multi-drug resistant malaria, preparations of artemisinin or its 
derivatives (artemether or artesunate) offer the only prospect of 
cure. They should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy. 
For the treatment of multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria oral 
artesunate may be an effective antimalarial. It should always be 
given in combination with mefloquine. Parenteral artemether or 
artesunate, whose use is restricted, are effective alternatives to 
quinine for the treatment of severe falciparum malaria and are 
preferred in areas where decreased efficacy of quinine has been 
documented. To ensure radical cure following parenteral treat-
ment with artemether or oral treatment with artesunate, a full 
therapeutic dose of mefloquine should be given. A fixed-dose oral 
formulation of artemether with lumefantrine has recently become 
available and is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated 
falciparum malaria in areas with significant resistance. The combi-
nation is not for use in pregnancy or lactation.
177
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
Prophylaxis Against Malaria:
No drug regimen gives assured protection to everybody and 
indiscriminate use of antimalarials can increase the risk of 
inducing resistance. 
Chloroquine, which is usually well tolerated at the required 
dosage, is preferred where P. falciparum remains fully sensi-
tive. The combination of proguanil with chloroquine may 
overcome mild chloroquine resistance. Chloroquine must be 
started 1 week before exposure and be continued in pregnant 
women until after delivery and for at least 4 weeks after the 
last risk of exposure in the case of non-immune individuals. 
This is sufficient to ensure elimination of P. falciparum and 
P. malariae, but not of P. vivax and P. ovale, whose residual 
hepatic forms survive.
Mefloquine may be used for prophylaxis in areas of high risk 
or where multiple-drug resistance has been reported. Where 
possible prophylaxis should be started 2-3 weeks before travel 
to enable any adverse reactions to be identified before expo-
sure (over three-quarters of adverse reactions occur by the 
third dose) and should be continued for 4 weeks after last 
exposure. Mefloquine may be used for prophylaxis during 
the second and third trimesters. It should be used in early 
pregnancy only if alternative drugs are either not available or 
unlikely to be effective and when it is impracticable for the 
woman to leave the endemic area.
Proguanil, a predominantly tissue schizonticide with little 
blood schizonticidal activity, is a causal prophylactic agent 
since it is active against pre-erythrocytic intrahepatic forms, 
particularly of P. falciparum. The latent persistent liver forms 
of P. ovale and P. vivax are unresponsive. However, there is 
evidence that it may be effective against P. vivax only imme-
diately after the initial infection. P. falciparum resistance 
to proguanil or related compounds may occur in malaria 
endemic areas and particularly where it has been employed in 
mass prophylaxis. Proguanil is used for prophylaxis with chlo-
roquine in areas where there is resistance to chloroquine but 
a low risk of infection as it may give some protection against 
and may alleviate symptoms if an attack occurs. Proguanil and 
chloroquine may also be used prophylactically in areas of high 
risk or multi-drug resistance as a second choice where meflo-
quine is not appropriate.
There is no evidence that proguanil is harmful in prophylactic 
doses during pregnancy. Because of the vulnerablility of preg-
nant women to falciparum malaria, it should be used at full 
prophylactic dosage wherever the disease is prevalent and 
likely to be responsive to proguanil, if chloroquine is not avail-
able or with chloroquine, if the latter alone is unlikely to be 
effective.

9.8 Antimycobacterial Drugs
9.8.1 Antileprosy Drugs
Leprosy is a chronic mycobacterial infection due to Mycobac-
terium leprae, which is a slow-growing intracellular bacillus 
that infiltrates the skin, peripheral nerves, the nasal and other 
mucosa and the eyes; it affects people of all ages and both 
sexes. The incubation period between infection and appear-
ance of leprosy is normally between 2 to 10 years, but may be 
up to 20 years. It is transmitted from person-to-person when 
bacilli are shed from the nose; most individuals have natural 
immunity and symptoms are suppressed. For treatment 
purposes patients may be classified as having paucibacillary 
(PB) or multibacillary (MB) leprosy. The 2 forms may be distin-
guished by skin smears, but facilities are not always available 
to process them and their reliability is often doubtful. In prac-
tice, most leprosy programmes classify and choose a regimen 
based on number of skin lesions; these are PB leprosy (1-5 
skin lesions) and MB leprosy (more than 5 skin lesions).
Drugs used in the treatment of leprosy should always be used 
in combination; this is essential to prevent the emergence of 
resistance. Rifampicin is now combined with dapsone to treat 
PB leprosy and rifampicin and clofazimine are now combined 
with dapsone to treat MB leprosy. The WHO Programme for 
the Elimination of Leprosy currently provides, free of charge, 
oral multidrug therapy in colour-coded blister packs (MDT 
blister packs) to improve patients’ adherence to treatment. 
Any patient with a positive skin smear should be treated with 
the MDT regimen for MB leprosy. The regimen for PB leprosy 
should never be given to a patient with MB leprosy. If diagnosis 
classification in a particular patient is not possible the MDT 
regimen for MB leprosy must be used.
Lepra reactions are episodes of sudden increase in the activity 
of leprosy and are often accompanied by neuritis; reactions 
must always be treated promptly to prevent permanent nerve 
damage and disability. Leprosy multidrug therapy should 
continue during a lepra reaction without interruption. This 
reduces the frequency and severity of lepra reactions.
Type 1 lepra reactions, or reversal reactions, are delayed 
hypersensitivity reactions and may occur in either PB or MB 
leprosy. If there is no nerve damage, type 1 reactions may be 
treated with analgesics such as acetylsalicylic acid or para-
cetamol. If there is nerve involvement corticosteroids, such as 
oral prednisolone should be used in addition to analgesics.
The type 2 lepra reaction, also known as erythema nodosum 
188
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
leprosum (ENL), is an antibody response to dead leprosy 
bacteria and occurs only in MB leprosy. Therapy for type 2 
reactions may include analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid or 
paracetamol and a corticosteroid, such as oral prednisolone. 
In patients not responding to a corticosteroid, clofazimine 
may be used. Severe type 2 lepra reactions should be treated 
under medical supervision in hospital.
If a patient does not respond to lepra reaction treatment 
within 6 weeks or seems to become worse, the patient must 
be sent immediately to the nearest specialist centre. Neuritis 
may occur during or independently of lepra reactions. It can 
be successfully treated with a 12-week course of oral pred-
nisolone; if patients do not respond, specialist centre treat-
ment is required.
Treatment Regimens:
The recommended regimen for paucibacillary leprosy in adults 
(50-70 kg) is rifampicin 600 mg once monthly and dapsone 100 
mg daily. Children aged 10-14 years may be given rifampicin 
450 mg once monthly and dapsone 50 mg daily. Appropriate 
dose adjustments are required for younger children. For 
example, dapsone 25 mg daily and rifampicin 300 mg once a 
month. Treatment is continued for 6 months for PB leprosy.
The recommended regimen for MB leprosy in adults (50-70 
kg) is rifampicin 600 mg and clofazimine 300 mg, both given 
once a month together with clofazimine 50 mg and dapsone 
100 mg, both daily. Children aged 10-14 years may be given 
rifampicin 450 mg and clofazimine 150 mg, both once a 
month together with clofazimine 50 mg every other day and 
dapsone 50 mg daily. Appropriate dosage adjustments are 
required for younger children. For example, dapsone 25 mg 
daily, clofazimine 50 mg twice a week and clofazimine 100 mg 
and rifampicin 300 mg once a month. Treatment is continued 
for 12 months for MB leprosy.
For patients who cannot take rifampicin because of allergy, 
other diseases, or rifampicin-resistant leprosy and for patients 
who refuse to take clofazimine, there are alternative regimens 
which incorporate ofloxacin and minocycline

9.8.2 Antituberculosis Drugs
Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused primarily 
by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or sometimes by M. bovis. 
Infection is usually due to inhalation of infected droplet 
nuclei with the lung generally being the first organ affected, 
but the primary infection is usually asymptomatic. Infec-
tion and inflammatory responses resolve with the develop-
ment of acquired immunity. Surviving bacteria may become 
dormant or in susceptible patients, progress to active 
primary disease; dormant organisms may produce disease 
and this often occurs if immune status is altered.
Tuberculosis is the most prevalent infectious disease of 
adults and causes 26% of avoidable adult deaths in the 
developing world. More than 80% of tuberculosis cases are 
pulmonary (PTB). At least 30% of patients who are infected 
with HIV will also develop active tuberculosis. The increase 
in resistant strains and poor compliance of dosage regimen 
which may contribute to resistance and treatment failure 
has led to the development of regimens with directly super-
vised treatment. Directly observed treatment short-course 
(DOTS) therapy which lasts for 6 or 8 months, given under 
direct observation is one of the most important components 
of the WHO strategy against tuberculosis. Simplified drug 
regimens and intermittent therapy have been introduced 
to improve compliance. WHO does not generally recom-
mend twice weekly regimens. If a patient receiving a twice 
weekly regimen misses a dose of tablets, the missed dose 
represents a bigger fraction of the total number of treat-
ment doses than if the patient was receiving a three times 
weekly or daily dose regimen. Therefore, there is a greater 
risk of treatment failure with twice weekly regimens. Fixed-
dose combination tablets incorporating 2 or more drugs are 
also used to improve compliance and decrease medication 
errors; they should be used unless one of the components 
cannot be given because of resistance or intolerance.
Modern short-course therapy is usually in 2 phases. The 
initial phase (2 months) involves the concurrent use of 
at least 3 drugs to reduce the bacterial population rapidly 
and prevent drug-resistant bacteria emerging. The second 
continuation phase (4-6 months) involves fewer drugs and is 
used to eliminate any remaining bacteria and prevent recur-
rence. Direct observation of therapy is considered essential 
to ensure compliance in the initial phase and also useful in 
the continuation phase if patients are receiving rifampicin. 
Five antituberculosis drugs, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazina-
mide, streptomycin (which are bactericidal) and ethambutol 
193
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
(which is bacteriostatic) are used in various combinations as 
part of WHO-recommended treatment regimens; thiaceta-
zone is used only if ethambutol cannot be used. In supervised 
regimens change of drug regimen should be considered only 
if the patient fails to respond after 5 months of DOTS.
Isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are components of all 
antituberculosis drug regimens currently recommended by 
WHO. Unsupervised and alternative regimens as set out in 
the following tables may be administered as specified.
Additional 
reserve 
antituberculosis 
drugs 
(amikacin, 
p-aminosalicylic acid, capreomycin, ciprofloxacin, cyclo-
serine, ethionamide, kanamycin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin ) 
for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis should 
be used in specialized centres adhering to WHO standards 
for TB control.
Worldwide, an important predisposing cause of immunosup-
pression leading to tuberculosis is human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection; it increases susceptibility to primary 
infection and increases the reactivation rate of tuberculosis. 
Preventative antituberculosis therapy of such persons is 
recommended.
Chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid can prevent the devel-
opment of clinically apparent disease in persons in close 
contact with infectious patients and also prevent the reac-
tivation of previously dormant disease in other persons at 
high risk particularly those who are immunodeficient.
Where the disease remains highly prevalent routine immuni-
zation of infants within the first year of age with BCG vaccine 
is cost-effective. However, there is no evidence that BCG will 
protect children older than 15 years of age. Infants born to 
HIV-positive mothers should be vaccinated during the first 
year of life, provided they have no clinical signs suggestive 
of HIV.
The tuberculin test has limited diagnostic value. A positive 
tuberculin test indicates previous exposure to mycobacterial 
antigens through infection with one of the tubercle bacilli, 
or BCG vaccination. The tuberculin test does not distinguish 
between tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infection, 
between active and quiescent disease, or between acquired 
infection and seroconversion induced by BCG vaccination.

DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course)
The WHO-recommended Directly Observed Treatment, Short 
Course (DOTS) strategy was launched formally as Revised 
National TB Control Programme in India in 1997 after pilot 
testing from 1993-1996. Since then DOTS has been widely 
advocated and successfully applied. (Revised National TB 
Control Policy)
DOTS is the most effective strategy available for controlling TB.
The five key components of DOTS are
a)	 Political commitment to control TB;
b)	 Case detection by sputum smear microscopy examination 
among symptomatic patients;
c)	 Patients are given anti- TB drugs under the direct 
observation of the health care provider/community DOT 
provider;
d)	 Regular, uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs; and
e)	 Systematic recording and reporting system that allows 
assessment of treatment results of each and every patient 
and of whole TB control programme.
Responsibility of ensuring regular and complete treatment of 
the patient lies with the health system.
In 2006, the new stop TB strategy was recommended interna-
tionally by WHO. The components of the new stop TB strategy 
are the following:
1.	 Pursue high quality DOTS expansion and enhancement
2.	 Address TB/HIV, MDR-TB and other challenges
3.	 Contribute to health system strengthening
4.	 Engage all health care providers
5.	 Empower people with TB and communities
6.	 Enable and promote research
DOTS involves treatment with combination of drugs 
-Rifampicin 300 mg + Isoniazid 150 mg + Pyrazinamide 800 
mg + Ethambutol 550 mg, given thrice weekly. Twice weekly 
therapy can also be given but it is not recommended since it 
does not have margin for error and missing even one dose 
makes the therapy ineffective.

9.9 Antipneumocystosis and  
Antitoxoplasmosis Drugs
Pneumocystosis:
Pneumocystis carinii is classified as a protozoan although there 
is evidence to suggest that it is probably a fungus. Pneumo-
cystis carinii pneumonia is probably acquired by the airborne 
route. In otherwise healthy persons it rarely, produces signs 
of infection. However, it is a frequent cause of opportunistic 
infection in immunosuppressed, debilitated or malnourished 
patients; it is the commonest cause of pneumonia in AIDS 
and the most frequent immediate cause of death in these 
patients.
Sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim is the treatment of 
choice for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and is also used 
for prophylaxis in high-risk patients; pentamidine isothionate 
is used in patients unresponsive to or intolerant of sulfameth-
oxazole with trimethoprim.
The treatment of Pneumocystis carinii infections must only be 
undertaken with specialist supervision where there are appro-
priate monitoring facilities.
Toxoplasmosis:
Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the protozoan para-
site Toxoplasma gondii. Most infections are self-limiting and 
do not require treatment. However, in immunodeficiency, 
primary infection may result in encephalitis, myocarditis or 
pneumonitis; impairment of immunity (such as in AIDS) in 
a previously infected person, may result in encephalitis or 
meningoencephalitis. Congenital transmission may occur if 
there is a primary infection in early pregnancy or if the mother 
is immunodeficient. Such cases often result in spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death or severe congenital disease. Ocular 
toxoplasmosis causes chorioretinitis and is often the result of 
a childhood infection that becomes apparent in adulthood.
The treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis is pyrimethamine 
with sulfadiazine; a folate supplement is also given to coun-
teract the megaloblastic anaemia associated with these drugs.

9.10 Antiretrovirals
Antiretroviral drugs do not cure HIV (human immunodeficiency 
virus) infection; they only temporarily suppress viral replica-
tion and improve symptoms. Patients receiving these drugs 
require careful monitoring by appropriately trained health 
professionals in an adequately resourced setting. Rigorous 
promotion of measures to prevent new infections remains 
essential and its need is not diminished by the availability of 
antiretroviral drugs. Effective therapy requires the simulta-
neous use of 3 or 4 drugs; alternative regimens are necessary 
to meet specific requirements at start-up, to substitute for 
first-line regimens in cases of intolerance, or to replace failing 
regimens. The use of a 3- or 4-drug combination as speci-
fied in the WHO treatment guidelines is recommended. The 
use of fixed-dose preparations for these combinations is also 
recommended if the pharmaceutical quality is assured and 
interchangeability with the single products is demonstrated 
as specified by the relevant drug regulatory authority.
Selection of 2 or 3 protease inhibitors from the Model List 
will need to be determined by each country after considera-
tion of local treatment guidelines and experience, as well as 
comparative costs of available products. Low-dose ritonavir is 
used in combination with indinavir, lopinavir or saquinavir as 
a ‘booster’; ritonavir is not recommended as a drug in its own 
right.
Principles of Treatment:
Treatment is aimed at reducing the plasma viral load as much 
as possible and for as long as possible; it should be started 
before the immune system is irreversibly damaged. The need 
for early drug treatment should, however, be balanced against 
the development of toxicity. Commitment to treatment and 
strict adherence over many years are required; the regimen 
chosen should take into account convenience and the patient’s 
tolerance of it. The development of resistance is reduced by 
using a combination of 3 or 4 drugs; such combinations should 
have additive or synergistic activity while ensuring that their 
toxicity is not additive. Testing for resistance to antiviral drugs, 
particularly in therapeutic failure, should be considered.
Women of childbearing age receiving antiretroviral therapy 
must have available effective contraceptive methods to 
prevent unintended pregnancy. Women who are taking non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibi-
tors which can lower blood concentration of hormonal oral 
contraceptives, should be advised to use additional or alterna-
tive contraceptives.
208
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
Drugs used to treat Hiv Infection:
Zidovudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (or 
‘nucleoside analogue’), was the first anti-HIV drug introduced. 
Other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors include 
abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine and zalcitabine.
The protease inhibitors include amprenavir, indinavir, lopi-
navir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir. Ritonavir in low doses 
is used in combination with indinavir, lopinavir or saquinavir 
as a booster. The small amount of ritonavir in such combi-
nations has no intrinsic antiviral activity but it increases the 
antiviral activity of the other protease inhibitors by reducing 
their metabolism. Indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and possibly 
saquinavir inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and 
therefore have a potential for significant drug interactions. 
Protease inhibitors are associated with lipodystrophy and 
metabolic effects (see below).
The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors include 
efavirenz and nevirapine. They interact with a number of drugs 
metabolized in the liver; the doses of protease inhibitors may 
need to be increased when they are given with efavirenz or 
nevirapine. Nevirapine is associated with a high incidence of 
rash (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and occasionally 
fatal hepatitis. Rash is also associated with efavirenz but it is 
usually milder. Efavirenz treatment has also been associated 
with an increased plasma cholesterol concentration.
Initiation of Treatment
The time for initiating antiviral treatment is determined by the 
clinical stage of the HIV infection as indicated by symptoms 
and where available, by the CD4-cell count or total lymphocyte 
count; the plasma viral load, if available, is also a valuable 
guide for staging the disease (see Monitoring, below).
Recommended initial treatment with a combination of drugs 
(‘highly active antiretroviral therapy’, HAART) includes:
2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
plus 
a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
or a third nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
or a protease inhibitor which may be combined with ritonavir 
as booster.
Monitoring:
In resource-limited settings the basic clinical assessment 
before initiating antiretroviral therapy includes documenta-
tion of past medical history, identification of current and past 
209
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
HIV-related illnesses, identification of co-existing medical 
conditions that may influence the choice of therapy (for 
example, pregnancy or tuberculosis) as well as current symp-
toms and physical signs.
The absolute minimum laboratory tests before initiating 
antiretroviral therapy are an HIV antibody test (in patients 
over 18 months of age) and a haemoglobin or haematocrit 
measurement.
Additional basic testing should include:
white blood cell count;
•	
differential cell count (to identify a decline in 
•	
neutrophils and the possibility of neutropenia);
total lymphocyte count; 
•	
serum alanine or aspartate aminotransferase concen-
•	
tration to assess the possibility of hepatitis co-infec-
tion and to monitor for hepatotoxicity; 
serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen to assess 
•	
baseline renal function; 
serum glucose;
•	
pregnancy tests for women.
•	
Desirable supplemental tests include measurement of 
bilirubin, amylase and serum lipids. CD4-cell determinations 
are, of course, very desirable and efforts should be made to 
make these widely available. Viral load testing is currently 
considered optional because of constraints on resources.
Changing Therapy:
Deterioration of the condition (including clinical and viro-
logical changes) usually calls for replacement of the failing 
drugs. Intolerance to adverse effects and drug-induced organ 
dysfunction usually require change in therapy.
The choice of an alternative regimen depends on factors 
such as the response to previous treatment, tolerance and 
the possibility of cross-resistance. If treatment fails, a new 
second-line regimen will be needed. If toxicity occurs, either 
a new second-line regimen is indicated or, if the toxicity is 
related to an identifiable drug in the regimen, the offending 
drug can be replaced with another drug that does not have 
the same adverse effects.
Pregnancy:
Treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy aims to: 
minimize the viral load and disease progression in the 
•	
mother;
210
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
reduce the risk of toxicity to the fetus (although the 
•	
teratogenic potential of most antiretroviral drugs is 
unknown);
prevent transmission of infection to the neonate.
•	
In pregnant women, it may be desirable to initiate antiretro-
viral therapy after the first trimester, although for pregnant 
women who are severely ill, the benefit of early therapy 
outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. All treatment options 
require careful assessment by a specialist.
The use of zidovudine, lamivudine, nevirapine, nelfinavir and 
saquinavir are recommended for women of child-bearing 
potential or who are pregnant. Efavirenz should be avoided 
because of its potential teratogenic effect on the fetus in the 
first trimester. First-line treatment in pregnant women should 
when possible include zidovudine and lamivudine. Mono-
therapy with either zidovudine or with nevirapine reduces 
transmission of infection to the neonate (see also below), 
but combination antiretroviral therapy maximizes the chance 
of preventing transmission and represents optimal therapy 
for the mother. Low-dose ritonavir is required if either indi-
navir or saquinavir is used in pregnancy because adequate 
drug concentration is achieved only with ritonavir boosting. 
Information is lacking on the use of lopinavir with ritonavir in 
pregnancy.
Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis associated with nucleo-
side reverse transcriptase inhibitors may be more frequent in 
pregnant women and therefore the combination of stavudine 
and didanosine should be used in pregnancy only when no 
alternatives are available. Protease inhibitors have been asso-
ciated with glucose intolerance and pregnant women should 
be instructed to recognize symptoms of hyperglycaemia and 
to seek health care advice if they occur.
Various regimens have been used to specifically prevent the 
transmission of HIV from mother to the neonate at term. 
More information is available in New Data on the Preven-
tion of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV and their Policy 
Implications: Conclusions and Recommendations (WHO/
RHR/01.28), which reflects an inter-agency consultation, held 
on 11-13 October 2000.
Lactation:
Antiretroviral drugs may be present in breastmilk and may 
reduce viral load in breastmilk and reduce the risk of trans-
mission through lactation. However, the concentration of 
antiretroviral drugs in breastmilk may not be adequate to 
211
NFI-2011
Anti-Infectives
prevent viral replication and there is therefore the possibility 
of promoting the development of drug-resistant virus which 
could be transmitted to the infant.
Women with HIV infection should be counselled about the 
risks of lactation and, where possible, they should limit or avoid 
lactation; in particular, lactation should be avoided where 
replacement feeding is acceptable, affordable, sustainable 
and safe. HIV-infected women should be counselled on infant 
feeding options and they should be supported in their choice.
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis:
Treatment with antiretroviral drugs may be appropriate 
following occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated mate-
rial. Immediate expert advice should be sought in such cases; 
national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis for health-
care workers have been developed and local ones may also 
be available.
Lipodystrophy and Metabolic Effects:
Combination antiretroviral therapy, including regimens 
containing a protease inhibitor, is associated with redistribu-
tion of body fat in some patients (for example, decreased fat 
under the skin, increased abdominal fat, ‘buffalo humps’ and 
breast enlargement). Protease inhibitors are also associated 
with metabolic abnormalities such as hyperlipidaemia, insulin 
resistance and hyperglycaemia. Clinical examination should 
include an evaluation of fat distribution; measurement of 
serum lipids and blood glucose should be considered.

Transcriptase Inhibitors
In some settings it may not be possible to carry out full moni-

9.11 Antischistosomals and Antitrematode Drugs
Schistosomiasis:
Schistosomiasis, a waterborne parasitic infection, is caused by 
several species of trematode worms (blood flukes). Its socio-
economic impact as a parasitic disease is outstripped only by 
that of malaria. Intestinal schistosomiasis is caused principally 
by Schistosoma mansoni as well as S. japonicum, S. mekongi 
and S. intercalatum. Urinary schistosomiasis is caused by S. 
haematobium. The latter is an important predisposing cause 
of squamous cell cancer of the bladder.
Praziquantel has transformed the treatment of schistosomiasis 
and is often effective in a single dose, against all species of the 
parasite. It can be of particular value in patients with mixed 
infections and those who do not respond adequately to other 
drugs. It is also extremely well tolerated and well suited for 
mass treatment control programmes. Extensive use over 
several years has provided no evidence of serious adverse 
effects or long-term toxicity, nor has mutagenic or carcino-
genic activity been shown in experimental animals.
Drugs still widely used in the treatment of schistosomiasis 
include oxamniquine, which is effective against S. mansoni. It 
is preferable to delay treatment with oxamniquine in pregnant 
women until after delivery unless immediate intervention is 
essential. Due to lack of information on whether oxamniquine 
is excreted in breast milk, it is preferable not to administer it 
to nursing mothers.

9.12 Antiviral Drugs
Herpes and Cytomegalovirus Infections:
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV):
Acyclovir is active against herpes viruses but does not eradi-
cate them. It is only effective if started at onset of infection; it 
is also used for prevention of recurrence in the immunocom-
promised patients. Genital lesions, oesophagitis and proc-
titis may be treated with oral Acyclovir. HSV encephalitis or 
pneumonitis should be treated with intravenous Acyclovir.
Valacyclovir, a prodrug of Acyclovir, can be given by mouth as 
an alternative treatment for herpes simplex infections of the 
skin and mucous membranes (including initial and recurrent 
genital herpes).
Herpes Zoster Virus:
While most HIV positive patients with zoster experience 
only one self-limiting course, some will experience repeated 
episodes. Treatment should be reserved for debilitating 
disease and when there is high risk of serious complications, 
such as in advanced HIV disease. Acyclovir is the treatment of 
choice and it can be administered in high oral dose or in the 
case of lack of response to oral therapy or CNS involvement, it 
should be given intravenously.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV):
Parenteral antiviral ganciclovir arrests retinochoroiditis and 
enteritis caused by CMV in HIV infected patients. Mainte-
nance therapy with oral ganciclovir should be given to prevent 
relapse of retinitis. Alternative therapy with intravenous 
foscarnet can be used if necessary.

13. Cardiovascular Drugs
13.1 Antianginal Drugs
The three main types of angina are:
Stable angina
•	
 (angina of effort), where atherosclerosis 
restricts blood flow in the coronary vessels; attacks 
are usually caused by exertion and relieved by rest
Unstable angina
•	
 (acute coronary insufficiency), which 
is considered to be an intermediate stage between 
stable angina and myocardial infarction
Prinzmetal angina
•	
 (variant angina), caused by coro-
nary vasospasm, in which attacks occur at rest.
Management depends on the type of angina and may include 
drug treatment, coronary artery bypass surgery, or percuta-
neous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
Stable Angina:
Drugs are used both for the relief of acute pain and for proph-
ylaxis to reduce further attacks; they include organic nitrates, 
beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and calcium-
channel blockers.
Nitrates:
Organic nitrates have a vasodilating effect; they are some-
times used alone, especially in elderly patients with infre-
quent symptoms. Tolerance leading to reduced antianginal 
effect is often seen in patients taking prolonged-action nitrate 
formulations. Evidence suggests that patients should have a 
‘nitrate-free’ interval to prevent the development of toler-
ance. Adverse effects such as flushing, headache and postural 
hypotension may limit nitrate therapy but tolerance to these 
effects also soon develops. The short-acting sublingual 
formulation of glyceryl trinitrate is used both for prevention 
of angina before exercise or other stress and for rapid treat-
ment of chest pain. A sublingual tablet of isosorbide dinitrate 
is more stable in storage than glyceryl trinitrate and is useful 
in patients who require nitrates infrequently; it has a slower 
onset of action, but effects persist for several h.
Beta-Blockers:
Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), such as aten-
olol, block beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and thereby 
decrease heart rate and myocardial contractility and oxygen 
280
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
consumption, particularly during exercise. Beta-blockers are 
first-line therapy for patients with effort-induced chronic 
stable angina; they improve exercise tolerance, relieve symp-
toms, reduce the severity and frequency of angina attacks and 
increase the anginal threshold.
Beta-blockers should be withdrawn gradually to avoid precipi-
tating an anginal attack; they should not be used in patients 
with underlying coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s angina).
Beta-blockers may precipitate asthma and should not be used 
in patients with asthma or a history of obstructive airways 
disease. Some, including atenolol, have less effect on β2 
(bronchial) receptors and are therefore relatively cardioselec-
tive. Although they have less effect on airways resistance they 
are not free of this effect and should be avoided.
Beta-blockers slow the heart and may induce myocardial depres-
sion, rarely, precipitating heart failure. They should not be given 
to patients who have incipient ventricular failure, second-or third-
degree atrioventricular block, or peripheral vascular disease.
Beta-blockers should be used with caution in diabetes since 
they may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, such as rapid 
heart rate. Beta-blockers enhance the hypoglycaemic effect of 
insulin and may precipitate hypoglycaemia.
Calcium-Channel Blockers:
A calcium-channel blocker, such as verapamil, is used as an 
alternative to a beta-blocker to treat stable angina. Calcium-
channel blockers interfere with the inward movement of 
calcium ions through the slow channels in heart and vascular 
smooth muscle cell membranes, leading to relaxation of 
vascular smooth muscle. Myocardial contractility may be 
reduced, the formation and propagation of electrical impulses 
within the heart may be depressed and coronary or systemic 
vascular tone may be diminished. Calcium-channel blockers 
are used to improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic 
stable angina due to coronary atherosclerosis or with abnor-
mally small coronary arteries and limited vasodilator reserve.
Calcium-channel blockers can also be used in patients with 
unstable angina with a vasospastic origin, such as Prinzmetal’s 
angina and in patients in whom alterations in cardiac tone 
may influence the angina threshold.
Unstable Angina:
Unstable angina requires prompt aggressive treatment to 
prevent progression to myocardial infarction.
Initial treatment is with acetylsalicylic acid to inhibit platelet 
aggregation, followed by heparin. Nitrates and beta-blockers 
are given to relieve ischaemia; if beta-blockers are contrain-
281
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
dicated, verapamil is an alternative, provided left ventricular 
function is adequate.
Prinzmetal’s Angina:
Treatment is similar to that for unstable angina, except that a 
calcium-channel blocker is used instead of a beta-blocker.

13.2 Antiarrhythmic Drugs
Treatment of arrhythmias requires precise diagnosis of the 
type of arrhythmia and electrocardiography is essential; 
underlying causes such as heart failure require appropriate 
treatment.
Antiarrhythmic drugs must be used cautiously since most 
drugs that are effective in treating arrhythmias can provoke 
them in some circumstances; this arrhythmogenic effect is 
often enhanced by hypokalaemia. When antiarrhythmic drugs 
are used in combination, their cumulative negative inotropic 
effects may be significant, particularly if myocardial function 
is impaired.
Atrial Fibrillation:
The increased ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation can be 
controlled with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) 
or verapamil. Digoxin is often effective for controlling the rate 
at rest; it is also appropriate if atrial fibrillation is accompa-
nied by congestive heart failure. Intravenous digoxin is occa-
sionally required if the ventricular rate needs rapid control. 
If adequate control at rest or during exercise cannot be 
achieved readily verapamil may be introduced with digoxin, 
but it should be used with caution if ventricular function is 
impaired. Anticoagulants are indicated especially in valvular 
or myocardial disease and in the elderly. Warfarin is preferred 
to acetylsalicylic acid in preventing emboli. If atrial fibrillation 
began within the previous 48 h and there does not appear to 
be a danger of thromboembolism, antiarrhythmic drugs, such 
as procainamide or quinidine, may be used to terminate the 
fibrillation or to maintain sinus rhythm after cardioversion.
Atrial Flutter:
Digoxin will sometimes slow the ventricular rate at rest. Rever-
sion to sinus rhythm is best achieved by direct current elec-
trical shock. If the arrhythmia is long-standing, treatment with 
an anticoagulant should be considered before cardioversion 
to prevent emboli. Intravenous verapamil reduces ventricular 
fibrillation during paroxysmal (sudden onset and intermittent) 
attacks of atrial flutter. An initial intravenous dose may be 
followed by oral treatment; hypotension may occur with high 
doses. It should not be used for tachyarrhythmias where the 
QRS complex is wide unless a supraventricular origin has been 
established beyond doubt. If the flutter cannot be restored to 
sinus rhythm, antiarrhythmics such as quinidine can be used.
Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia:
In most patients this remits spontaneously or can revert to 
292
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
sinus rhythm by reflex vagal stimulation. Failing this, intrave-
nous injection of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) 
or verapamil may be effective. Verapamil and a beta-blocker 
should never be administered concomitantly because of the 
risk of hypotension and asystole.
Ventricular Tachycardia:
Very rapid ventricular fibrillation causes profound circula-
tory collapse and must be treated immediately with direct 
current shock. In more stable patients intravenous lidocaine or 
procainamide may be used. After sinus rhythm is restored, drug 
therapy to prevent recurrence of ventricular tachycardia should 
be considered; a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) 
or verapamil may be effective.
Torsades de pointes is a special form of ventricular tachy-
cardia associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Initial 
treatment with intravenous infusion of magnesium sulphate 
(usual dose 2g over 10-15 min, repeated once if necessary) 
together with temporary pacing is usually effective; alter-
natively, isoprenaline infusion may be given with extreme 
caution until pacing can be instituted. Isoprenaline is an 
inotropic sympathomimetic; it increases the heart rate and 
therefore shortens the QT interval, but given alone it may 
induce arrhythmias.
Bradyarrhythmias:
Sinus bradycardia (less than 50 beats/min) associated with acute 
myocardial infarction may be treated with atropine. Temporary 
pacing may be required in unresponsive patients. Drugs are of 
limited value for increasing the sinus rate long term in the pres-
ence of intrinsic sinus node disease and permanent pacing is 
usually required.
Cardiac Arrest:
In cardiac arrest, epinephrine (adrenaline) is given by intrave-
nous injection in a dose of 1 mg (10 ml of 1 in 10,000 solution) 
as part of the procedure for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

13.3 Antihypertensive Drugs
Management of Hypertension:
Treatment of hypertension should be integrated into an 
overall programme to manage factors that increase the risk of 
cardiovascular events (such as stroke and myocardial infarc-
tion). Treatment is oftten life-long. Hypertension was formerly 
classified as mild, moderate or severe, but a grading system is 
now preferred. Grade 1 hypertension is defined as 140-159 
mmHg systolic blood pressure and 90-99 mmHg diastolic 
blood pressure, Grade 2 hypertension 160-179 mmHg systolic 
and 100-109 mmHg diastolic and Grade 3 hypertension more 
than 180 mmHg systolic and more than 110 mmHg diastolic. 
The goal of treatment is to obtain the max. tolerated reduc-
tion in blood pressure.
Lifestyle changes should be introduced for all patients; they 
include weight reduction, reduction in alcohol intake, reduc-
tion of dietary Sodium, stopping tobacco smoking and reduc-
tion in saturated fat intake. The patient should eat a healthy 
nutritious diet including adequate fruit and vegetables and 
should exercise regularly. These measures alone may be suffi-
cient in mild hypertension, but patients with moderate to 
severe hypertension will also require specific antihypertensive 
therapy.
Drug Treatment of Hypertension:
Three classes of drug are used for first-line treatment of hyper-
tension: thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists 
(beta-blockers) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors. Calcium-channel blockers are considered first-line 
in specific populations only e.g. Africans or the elderly. Other 
classes of drugs may be used in certain situations.
Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, have been 
used as first-line antihypertensive therapy and are particularly 
indicated in the elderly. They have few adverse effects in low 
doses, but in large doses they may cause a variety of unwanted 
metabolic effects (principally potassium depletion), reduced 
glucose tolerance, ventricular ectopic beats and impotence; 
they should be avoided in gout. These effects can be reduced 
by keeping the dose as low as possible; higher doses do not 
produce an increased reduction in blood pressure. Thiazides 
are inexpensive and, when used in combination, can enhance 
the effectiveness of many other classes of antihypertensive 
drugs.
Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) such as aten-
olol are effective in all grades of hypertension and are particu-
303
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
larly useful in angina and following myocardial infarction; they 
should be avoided in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and heart block.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) 
such as enalapril are effective and well tolerated by most 
patients. They can be used in heart failure, left ventricular 
dysfunction and diabetic nephropathy, but should be avoided 
in renovascular disease and in pregnancy. The most common 
adverse effect is a dry persistent cough.
Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine 
are useful for isolated systolic hypertension, in populations 
unresponsive to other antihypertensives (e.g. Africans) and in 
the elderly when thiazides cannot be used. Short-acting formu-
lations of nifedipine should be avoided as they may evoke reflex 
tachycardia and cause large variations in blood pressure.
Drugs acting on the central nervous system are also effective 
antihypertensive drugs. In particular, methyldopa is effective 
in the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy.
A single antihypertensive drug is often not adequate and 
other antihypertensive drugs are usually added in a stepwise 
manner until blood pressure is controlled.
Hypertensive Emergencies
In situations where immediate reduction of blood pressure is 
essential and treatment by mouth is not possible, intravenous 
infusion of Sodium nitroprusside is effective. Over-rapid reduc-
tion in blood pressure is hazardous and can lead to reduced 
organ perfusion and cerebral infarction.
Hypertension in Pregnancy
This is defined as a sustained diastolic blood pressure of 90 
mmHg or more. Drug therapy for chronic hypertension during 
pregnancy remains controversial. If diastolic blood pressure is 
greater than 95 mmHg, methyldopa is the safest drug. Beta-
blockers should be used with caution in early pregnancy, since 
they may retard fetal growth; they are effective and safe in 
the third trimester. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in preg-
nancy since they may damage fetal and neonatal blood pres-
sure control and renal function. Women who are taking these 
drugs and become pregnant should have their antihyperten-
sive therapy changed immediately.
Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia: If pre-eclampsia or severe hyper-
tension occurs beyond the 36th week of pregnancy, delivery is 
the treatment of choice. For acute severe hypertension in pre-
eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous hydralazine can be used. 
Magnesium sulphate  is the treatment of choice to prevent 
eclamptic convulsions in eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia.

13.4 Antithrombotic Drugs 
Anticoagulants prevent thrombus formation or the extension 
of an existing thrombus. Antiplatelet drugs also help to inhibit 
thrombus formation by decreasing platelet aggregation.
Thrombolytics (fibrinolytics) such as streptokinase are used 
to break up thrombi; they are used to treat acute myocardial 
infarction, extensive deep vein thrombosis, major pulmonary 
embolism and acute arterial occlusion.
Myocardial Infarction:
Management of myocardial infarction includes two phases:
initial management of the acute attack
•	
long-term management, including prevention of 
•	
further attacks
1. Initial Management:
Oxygen should be given to all patients, except those with 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Pain and anxiety are relieved by slow intravenous injection of 
an opioid analgesic such as morphine. Metoclopramide may 
also be given by intramuscular injection to prevent and treat 
nausea and vomiting caused by morphine.
Acetylsalicylic acid 150-300 mg by mouth (preferably chewed 
or dispersed in water) is given immediately for its antiplatelet 
effect.
Thrombolytic drugs such as streptokinase help to restore 
perfusion and thus relieve myocardial ischaemia; they should 
ideally be given within 1 h of infarction (use after 12 h requires 
specialist advice).
Nitrates may also be given to relieve ischaemic pain.
Early administration of beta-blockers such as atenolol have 
been shown to reduce both early mortality and the recur-
rence rate of myocardial infarction; initial intravenous admin-
istration is followed by long-term oral treatment (unless the 
patient has contraindications).
ACE inhibitors have also been shown to be beneficial in initial 
management (unless patient has contraindications) when 
given within 24 h and if possible continued for 5-6 weeks.
If arrhythmias occur, they should be treated aggressively, 
but the likelihood decreases rapidly over the first 24 h after 
infarction. Ventricular fibrillation should be treated imme-
diately with a defibrillator; if this is ineffective alone, the 
antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine should be given.
All patients should be closely monitored for hyperglycaemia; 
316
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
those with diabetes mellitus or raised blood-glucose concen-
tration should receive insulin.
2. Long-term Management
Acetylsalicylic acid should be given to all patients in a dose of 
75-150 mg daily by mouth, unless it is contraindicated. The 
prolonged antiplatelet effect has been shown to reduce the 
rate of reinfarction.
Treatment with beta-blockers should be continued for at least 
1 year and possibly for up to 3 years.
ACE inhibitors such as enalapril should also be used since they 
reduce mortality, particularly in patients with left ventricular 
dysfunction.
Nitrates may be required for patients with angina.
The use of statins may also be considered in patients with high 
risk of recurrence.
Stroke:
Stroke (cerebrovascular accident) may be ischaemic or haem-
orrhagic; precise diagnosis is essential, as management for 
the two types of stroke is quite different.
Primary prevention of both types of stroke includes reduction 
of high blood pressure, stopping smoking, weight reduction 
and cholesterol reduction. Atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial 
infarction and valvular disease may produce embolism and 
ischaemic stroke. Prophylaxis in patients at risk of ischaemic 
stroke includes oral anticoagulants such as warfarin and 
antiplatelet drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid. Treatment of 
acute ischaemic stroke includes use of acetylsalicylic acid, 
anticoagulants such as heparin and of thrombolytics, such 
as streptokinase. Streptokinase must be used with extreme 
caution due to risk of bleeding. Long-term therapy with acetyl-
salicylic acid reduces the risk of having another stroke.
Antiplatelet and thrombolytic drugs are not used in the 
management of haemorrhagic stroke, as they may exacerbate 
bleeding. The main treatment is to normalize blood pressure.
Acetylsalicylic acid is normally given for at least one year after 
coronary artery bypass surgery. It is also given to patients 
with prosthetic heart valves who have had cerebral embolism 
despite warfarin treatment.

Precautions 
Should be used with caution if there is a risk 
of bleeding including that from venepuncture 
or invasive procedures. They should also 
be used with caution in external chest 
compression; pregnancy (Appendix 7c); 
elderly; hypertension; abdominal aneurysm 
or other conditions in which thrombolysis 
might give rise to embolic complications such 
as enlarged left atrium with atrial fibrillation 
(risk of dissolution of clot and subsequent 
embolisation); diabetic retinopathy (very 
small risk of retinal bleeding) and recent or 
concurrent use of drugs that increase the 
risk of bleeding; hematocrit platelet count; 
thrombin and prothrombin time.
Adverse Effects
Nausea; vomiting and bleeding. When 
used in myocardial infarction, reperfusion 
arrhythmias may occur. Hypotension can 
also occur and can usually be controlled by 
elevating the patient's legs or by reducing the 
rate of infusion or stopping it temporarily. 
Back pain; fever and convulsions have 
been reported. Bleeding is usually limited 
to the site of injection; but intracerebral 
haemorrhage or bleeding from other 
sites can occur. Serious bleeding calls for 
discontinuation of the thrombolytic and may 
require administration of coagulation factors 
and antifibrinolytic drugs (aprotinin or 
tranexamic acid). Rarely, further embolism 
may occur (either due to clots that break 
away from the original thrombus or to 
cholesterol crystal emboli). It causes allergic 
reactions (including rash; flushing and uveitis) 
and anaphylaxis has also been reported.
Storage
Store in a sealed container protected from 
light in refrigerator (2 to 8⁰C). The container 
should be sterile, tamper evident and sealed 
so as to exclude micro-organisms.

13.5 Blood Products and Plasma Substitutes 
13.5.1 Plasma Substitutes
Dextran 70 and polygeline are macromolecular substances 
which are metabolized slowly; they may be used to expand 
and maintain blood volume in shock arising from conditions 
such as burns or septicaemia. They are rarely, needed when 
shock is due to Sodium and water depletion as, in these 
circumstances, the shock responds to water and electrolyte 
repletion.
Plasma substitutes should not be used to maintain plasma 
volume in conditions such as burns or peritonitis where there 
is loss of plasma protein, water and electrolytes over periods of 
several days. In these situations, plasma or plasma protein frac-
tions containing large amounts of albumin should be given.
Plasma substitutes may be used as an immediate short-term 
measure to treat massive haemorrhage until blood is avail-
able, but large volumes of some plasma substitutes can 
increase the risk of bleeding by depleting coagulation factors. 
Dextran may interfere with blood group cross-matching or 
biochemical measurements and these should be carried out 
before the infusion is started.

13.5.2 Plasma Fraction for Specific Use
Factor VIII is essential for blood clotting and the maintenance 
of effective haemostasis; von Willebrand factor is a mediator in 
platelet aggregation and also acts as a carrier for factor VIII. Blood 
coagulation factors VII, IX and X are essential for the conversion 
of factor II (prothrombin) to thrombin. Deficiency in any of these 
factors results in haemophilia. Bleeding episodes in haemophilia 
326
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
require prompt treatment with replacement therapy. Factor VIII, 
used for the treatment of haemophilia A, is a sterile freeze-dried 
powder containing the blood coagulation factor VIII fraction 
prepared from pooled human venous plasma. Standard factor 
VIII preparations also contain von Willebrand factor and may be 
used to treat von Willebrand disease. Highly purified prepara-
tions, including recombinant factor VIII, are available; they are 
indicated for the treatment of haemophilia A but do not contain 
sufficient von Willebrand factor for use in the management of 
von Willebrand disease.
Factor IX Complex is a sterile freeze-dried concentrate of blood 
coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X derived from fresh venous 
plasma. Factor IX complex which is used for the treatment of 
haemophilia B may also be used for the treatment of bleeding 
due to deficencies of factor II, VII and X. High purity prepa-
rations of factor IX which do not contain clinically effective 
amounts of factor II, VII and X are available. A recombinant 
factor IX preparation is also available.

13.6 Drugs Affecting Coagulation 
Anticoagulants are used to prevent thrombus formation or 
extension of an existing thrombus in the slower-moving venous 
side of the circulation, where the thrombus consists of a fibrin 
web enmeshed with platelets and red cells. They are there-
fore used widely in the prevention and treatment of deep-
vein thrombosis in the legs, prophylaxis of embolization in 
rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation and to prevent 
thrombi forming on prosthetic heart valves.
Heparin is a parenteral anticoagulant that initiates antico-
agulation rapidly but has a short duration of action. The low 
molecular weight heparins have a longer duration of action.
For the treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmo-
nary embolism heparin is given as an intravenous loading 
dose followed by continuous intravenous infusion (using an 
infusion pump) or by intermittent subcutaneous injection. 
An oral anticoagulant is started at the same time as heparin. 
The heparin needs to be continued for at least 5 days, until 
the oral anticoagulant has taken effect and the INR (interna-
tional normalized ratio) has been in the therapeutic range for 
2 consecutive days. Laboratory monitoring is essential, on a 
daily basis. Heparin is also used in regimens for the manage-
ment of myocardial infarction, the management of unstable 
angina, acute peripheral arterial occlusion and in dialysis.
In patients undergoing general surgery, low-dose heparin 
by subcutaneous injection is used to prevent postoperative 
deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high risk 
patients (those with obesity, malignant disease, history of 
deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, patients over 
40 years, those with an established thrombophilic disorder or 
those undergoing major or complicated surgery). It is also of 
value in high-risk medical patients, for example obesity, heart 
failure, when confined to bed.
If haemorrhage occurs it is usually sufficient to withdraw 
heparin, but if rapid reversal of the effects of heparin is 
required, protamine sulphate  is a specific antidote.
Oral anticoagulants take at least 48-72 h for the anticoagulant 
effect to develop fully; if an immediate effect is needed, heparin 
must be given concomitantly. Warfarin is indicated in deep-
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, for patients with atrial 
fibrillation who are at risk of embolization and for those with 
mechanical prosthetic heart valves (to prevent emboli devel-
oping on the valves); oral anticoagulants should not be used 
in cerebral thrombosis or peripheral arterial occlusion as first-
line therapy. The main adverse effect of oral anticoagulants is 
330
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
haemorrhage. Prothrombin time (usually reported as INR, inter-
national normalized ratio) should be checked on a daily basis 
initially then at longer intervals depending on response.
If severe haemorrhage occurs, stop warfarin and give phytom-
enadione (vitamin K) by Slow intravenous injection
Anticoagulants in Pregnancy:
Oral anticoagulants are teratogenic and should not be given in 
the first trimester of pregnancy. Women at risk of pregnancy 
should be warned of this danger since stopping warfarin 
before the sixth week of gestation may largely avoid the risk of 
fetal abnormality. Oral anticoagulants cross the placenta with 
the risk of placental or fetal haemorrhage, especially during 
the last few weeks of pregnancy and at delivery. Therefore, 
if at all possible, oral anticoagulants should be avoided in 
pregnancy, especially in the first and third trimester. Difficult 
decisions may have to be made, particularly in women with 
prosthetic heart valves or with a history of recurrent venous 
thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
Haemophilia:
Desmopressin by injection may aid haemostasis and be useful 
in mild forms of haemophilia. For minor procedures including 
dental surgery, it may circumvent the need for factor VIII.

13.7 Drugs Used in Heart Failure
Treatment of heart failure aims to relieve symptoms, improve 
exercise tolerance, reduce incidence of acute exacerbations 
and reduce mortality. Drugs used to treat heart failure due 
to left ventricular systolic dysfunction include ACE inhibitors, 
diuretics, β-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol), 
cardiac glycosides and vasodilators. In addition, measures 
such as weight reduction, moderate salt restriction and appro-
priate exercise should be introduced. The primary treatment 
of heart failure is with ACE inhibitors such as enalapril which 
can be used in all stages of chronic heart failure to prevent 
further deterioration and progression of heart disease.
A thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide is used in 
the management of mild to moderate heart failure when 
the patient has mild fluid retention and severe pulmonary 
oedema is not present; however thiazides are ineffective if 
renal function is poor. In these patients and in more severe 
fluid retention, a loop diuretic such as furosemide is required. 
In severe fluid retention, intravenous furosemide produces 
relief from breathlessness and reduces preload sooner than 
would be expected from the time of onset of diuresis. Hypoka-
laemia may develop, but is less likely with the shorter-acting 
loop diuretics than with the thiazides; care is needed to avoid 
hypotension.
A combination of a thiazide and a loop diuretic may be 
required to treat refractory oedema. The combination often 
produces a synergistic effect on solute and water excretion, 
which relieves symptoms in the diuretic-resistant heart failure 
patient. However, the combination may produce excessive 
intravascular volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances 
including potentially life-threatening hypokalaemia.
The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone may be considered 
for patients with severe heart failure who are already receiving 
an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic; a low dose of spironolactone 
(usually 25 mg daily) reduces symptoms and mortality rate 
in these patients. Close monitoring of serum creatinine and 
potassium is necessary with any change in treatment or in the 
patient's clinical condition.
Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, increases the strength of cardiac 
muscle contractions and increases cardiac output. In mild 
heart failure, digoxin inhibits the sympathetic nervous system 
and produces arterial vasodilation. It produces symptomatic 
improvement, increases exercise tolerance and reduces hospi-
talization, but it does not reduce mortality. It is considered for 
patients with atrial fibrillation and those who remain sympto-
337
NFI-2011
Cardiovascular Drugs
matic despite treatment with an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic and 
a suitable beta-blocker.
Vasodilators are used in heart failure to reduce systemic 
vascular resistance. Isosorbide dinitrate produces mainly 
venous dilatation, which reduces left ventricular preload, 
leading to a reduction in pulmonary congestion and dysp-
noea. Hydralazine produces mainly arterial vasodilation, 
which reduces left ventricular afterload and increases stroke 
volume and cardiac output. Isosorbide dinitrate and hydrala-
zine can be used in combination when an ACE inhibitor cannot 
be used.
Dopamine, an inotropic sympathomimetic, may be given for 
short periods in the treatment of severe heart failure. Dosage 
is critical; at low doses it stimulates myocardial contractility 
and increases cardiac output, however, higher doses (more 
than 5 µg/kg per min) cause vasoconstriction, with a wors-
ening of heart failure.

13.8 Lipid Lowering Drugs
Drug therapy to lower plasma lipids should be used in addition 
to dietary management and correction of other modifiable 
cardiovascular risk factors. Studies indicate that, 1% drop in 
serum cholesterol reduces the risk for Coronary heart disease 
(CHD) by 2%. 
Various classes of drugs used as lipid lowering drugs are- 
H mg-CoA reductase inhibitors
They are the most efficacious and tolerable drugs like simv-
astatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin etc. They are primarily indi-
cated in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and 
stroke in patients who have symptomatic atherosclerotic 
disease following acute myocardial infarction or stroke and 
in primary prevention of arterial disease in patients who are 
at high risk because of elevated serum cholesterol concentra-
tion. Common adverse effects include mild gastrointestinal 
disturbances, rhabdomyolysis etc.
Fibric acid derivatives 
This class of drugs including fenofibrate, gemfibrozil etc are 
indicated in patients with mixed dyslipidemia (i.e. raised 
serum triglycerides and cholesterol), low high density lipopro-
tein (HDL) and high risk of atheromatous disease (often type 
2 diabetic patients), and in severe treatment- resistant dysli-
pidemia. Major adverse effect include rhabdomyolysis and 
myoglobulinuria. Fibrates are better avoided in alcoholics.
Bile acid sequestrants
Drugs like cholestyramine, colestipol though are not clinically 
popular because of interference with absorption of many 
drugs like digoxin, warfarin etc and poor patient acceptability, 
but can be indicated in heterozygous familiar hypercholeste-
rolemia. Adverse effects include nausea, abdominal bloating, 
constipation or diarrhoea. 
Nicotinic acid 
Nicotinic acid reduces serum cholesterol and triglycerides 
levels in types II, III, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemias. Adverse 
effects include flushing, palpitations and gastrointestinal tract 
disturbances.

23.1 Antiasthmatics and Drugs for Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Asthma:
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by 
episodes of reversible airways obstruction due to bronchial 
hyperresponsiveness; inflammation may lead to irreversible 
obstruction in few patients. A classification based on severity 
before the start of treatment and disease progression is of impor-
tance when decisions have to be made about management. 
It can be divided by severity into intermittent, mild persistent, 
moderate persistent and severe persistent. Antiasthmatics are 
useful in the management of the disease since therapy has a 
stepwise approach which must be discussed with the patient 
before commencing therapy. The level of therapy is increased 
as the severity of the asthma increases with stepping-down if 
control is sustained (see tables on treatment below).
Inhalation:
Medications for asthma can be administered in several different 
ways, including inhalation, oral and parenteral (subcutaneous, 
intramuscular or intravenous routes). The main advantage of 
delivering drugs directly into the airways via inhalation is that 
high concentrations can be delivered more effectively and 
rapidly to the airways, and systemic adverse effects avoided 
or minimized.
It is important that patients receive careful instruction in 
the use of pressurized (aerosol) inhalation (using a metered-
dose inhaler) to obtain optimum results. Before use, the 
inhaler should be shaken well. After exhaling as completely 
as possible, the mouthpiece of the inhaler should be placed 
well into the mouth and the lips fir mly closed around it. The 
patient should inhale deeply through the mouth while actu-
ating the inhaler. After holding the breath for 10 seconds or 
as long as is comfortable, the mouthpiece should be removed 
and the patient should exhale slowly.
It is important to check that patients continue to use their 
inhalers correctly as inadequate technique may be mistaken 
for drug failure. Spacing devices provide a space between the 
440
NFI-2011
Drugs for Respiratory Diseases
inhaler and the mouth. They may be of benefit for patients 
such as the elderly, small children and the asthmatic who 
find inhalers difficult to use or for those who have difficulty 
synchronizing their breathing with administration of the 
aerosol. A large volume spacing device is also recommended 
for inhalation of high doses of corticosteroids to reduce 
oropharyngeal deposition which can cause candidosis. The 
use of metered-dose inhalers with spacers is less expensive 
and may be as effective as use of nebulizers, although drug 
delivery may be affected by choice of spacing device.
Breath-actuated devices including dry powder inhalers are 
also available.
Solutions for nebulization are available for use in acute severe 
asthma. They are administered over a period of 5-10 min from 
a nebulizer, usually driven by oxygen in hospital.
Oral:
The oral route is used when administration by inhalation is not 
possible. Systemic adverse effects occur more frequently when 
a drug is given orally rather than by inhalation. Drugs given 
by mouth for the treatment of asthma include β2-agonists, 
corticosteroids and theophylline.
Parenteral:
Drugs such as corticosteroids, aminophylline etc. may be given 
by injection in acute severe asthma when administration by 
nebulization is inadequate or inappropriate. If the patient is 
being treated in the community, urgent transfer to hospital 
should be arranged.
Pregnancy:
Poorly controlled asthma in pregnant women can have an 
adverse effect on the fetus, resulting in perinatal mortality, 
increased prematurity and low birth-weight. For this reason 
using medications to obtain optimal control of asthma is 
justified. Administration of drugs by inhalation during preg-
nancy has the advantage that plasma drug concentrations 
are not likely to be high enough to have an effect on the 
fetus. Acute exacerbations should be treated aggressively in 
order to avoid fetal hypoxia.
Acute Exacerbation of Asthma:
Severe asthma can be fatal and must be treated promptly 
and energetically. Acute severe asthma attacks require 
hospital admission where resuscitation facilities are imme-
diately available.
Severe asthma is characterized by persistent dyspnoea 
441
NFI-2011
Drugs for Respiratory Diseases
poorly relieved by bronchodilators, exhaustion, a high pulse 
rate (usually more than 110/min) and a very low peak expira-
tory flow.
As asthma becomes more severe, wheezing may be absent. 
Patients should be given oxygen 40-60% (if available). 
Patients should also be given salbutamol or terbutaline via a 
nebulizer. In emergencies where a nebulizer is not available, 
salbutamol 100 µg by aerosol inhalation can be repeated 
10-20 times preferably using a large-volume spacing device. 
Patients should also be given a corticosteroid ; for adults, 
prednisolone 30-60 mg by mouth or hydrocortisone 200 
mg intravenously; for children, prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg by 
mouth (1-4 years, max. 20 mg, 5-15 years, max. 40 mg) or 
hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously; if the patient experi-
ences vomiting the parenteral route may be preferred for 
the first dose.
If response is inadequate, ipratropium by nebulizer should 
be considered. Most patients do not benefit from the addi-
tion of intravenous aminophylline or a parenteral β2-agonist; 
both cause more adverse effects than nebulized β2-agonists. 
Nevertheless, an occasional patient who has not been taking 
theophylline, may benefit from a slow intravenous infusion 
of aminophylline.
The use of epinephrine (adrenaline) in asthma has generally 
been superseded by β2-selective adrenoceptor agonists. 
Treatment should never be delayed for investigations, patients 
should never be sedated and the possibility of pneumoth-
orax should be considered. Patients who deteriorate further 
despite treatment may need intermittent positive pressure 
ventilation.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis 
and emphysema) may be helped by an inhaled short-acting 
β2-adrenoceptor agonist used as required or when the airways 
obstruction is more severe, by an inhaled anticholinergic 
(antimuscarinic) bronchodilator or both if necessary. Although 
many patients are treated with an inhaled corticosteroid its 
role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not clear at 
present. A limited trial of high-dose inhaled corticosteroid 
or an oral corticosteroid is recommended for patients with 
moderate airflow obstruction to determine the extent of the 
airway reversibility and to ensure that asthma has not been 
overlooked.
Long-term oxygen therapy prolongs survival in some patients 
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
445
NFI-2011
Drugs for Respiratory Diseases
β2-Adrenoceptor Agonists  
(β2-Adrenoceptor Stimulants):
The adrenoreceptors in bronchi are mainly β2 type and 
their stimulation causes bronchial muscles to relax. The 
β2-adrenoceptor agonists include salbutamol, terbutaline, and 
fenoterol.
When salbutamol is given by inhalation (100-200 µg) the effect 
can last as long as 4 h thus making it suitable for both the 
treatment (see tables) and prevention of asthma. Salbutamol 
can also be taken orally in a dose of 2-4 mg up to 4 times daily 
but is less effective and causes more adverse effects. It can 
also be given by injection for severe bronchospasm.
Adverse Effects
Cardiovascular adverse effects (arrhythmias, palpitations and 
tachycardia) may occur with salbutamol, but are infrequent 
with inhaled preparations. Hypokalaemia may result from 
β2-adrenoceptor agonist therapy. Particular caution is required 
in severe asthma because this effect may be potentiated by 
concomitant treatment with xanthines (for example theophyl-
line), corticosteroids, diuretics and hypoxia. Plasma potassium 
concentrations should be monitored in severe asthma.
Xanthines:
Xanthines include theophylline and aminophylline. They relax 
bronchial smooth muscle relieving bronchospasm and also 
stimulate respiration. Absorption of theophylline from the 
gastrointestinal tract is usually rapid and complete. It is metabo-
lized by the liver but its half-life can vary considerably in certain 
diseases including hepatic impairment and cardiac failure, with 
some coadministered drugs (see Appendix 5) as well as by 
factors such as age, smoking and alcohol intake. The half-life 
variation can be important because theophylline has a narrow 
margin between therapeutic and toxic effects. At therapeutic 
doses some patients experience nausea and diarrhoea and 
when plasma concentrations exceed the recommended range 
of 10-20 mg/litre (55-110 micromol/litre) arrhythmias and 
convulsions which may be fatal can occur. Monitoring of plasma 
concentrations is therefore recommended. Theophylline is used 
to treat chronic asthma, usually in the form of modified-release 
preparations which produce adequate plasma concentrations 
for up to 12 h. It is used as an adjunct to β2-agonist or corticos-
teroid therapy when additional bronchodilation is required but 
there is an increased risk of adverse effects with β2-agonists (see 
446
NFI-2011
Drugs for Respiratory Diseases
above). When given as a single dose at night, modified-release 
preparations may be useful in controlling nocturnal asthma and 
early morning wheezing.
The absorption characteristics of modified-release theophylline 
peparations vary considerably and therefore it is important to 
keep the patient on the same brand-name formulation.
Theophylline is given by injection as aminophylline (a mixture 
of theophylline with ethylenediamine) which is 20 times more 
soluble in water than theophylline alone. It is administered by 
slow intravenous injection in severe asthma attacks.
Corticosteroids:
Inhaled Corticosteroids:
Inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone, are the most 
effective anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of 
asthma. They are recommended for the long-term control of 
asthma in patients using a β2-adrenoceptor agonist more than 
once a day. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids reduces the 
risk of exacerbations of asthma.
Corticosteroids must be used regularly to obtain max. benefit. 
Symptom control is usually effective after 3 to 7 days treat-
ment. Long-term high-dose regimens of inhaled corticoster-
oids are useful for the treatment of severe persistent asthma 
because they both reduce the need for the long-term use of 
oral corticosteroids and have fewer systemic adverse effects.
Local adverse effects from inhaled corticosteroids include 
oropharyngeal 
candidosis, 
dysphonia 
and 
occasional 
coughing from upper airway irritation. The use of spacing 
devices reduces oropharyngeal deposition and thus reduces 
the incidence of candidosis. The risk for systemic effects of 
inhaled corticosteroids is small and is dependent upon the 
dose and potency of the corticosteroid as well as its bioavail-
ability and the plasma half-life of its systemically absorbed 
fraction. Systemic effects are rare and include skin thinning 
and easy bruising, a small increased risk of glaucoma and cata-
racts, adrenal suppression, decrease of bone metabolism and 
growth retardation in children.
Systemic Corticosteroids
Oral corticosteroids may be used as ‘max. therapy’ to achieve 
control of a patient’s asthma. This may be useful either when 
initiating long-term therapy for a patient with uncontrolled 
asthma or as a short ‘rescue’ course at any stage for acute 
exacerbation.
Long-term oral corticosteroid therapy may be required to 
447
NFI-2011
Drugs for Respiratory Diseases
control severe persistent asthma, but its use is limited by the risk 
of significant adverse effects. In these cases high-dose inhaled 
corticosteroids should be continued so that oral requirements 
are reduced to a minimum. Oral doses should be given as a 
single dose in the morning to reduce the disturbance to the 
circadian cortisol secretion. Dosage should always be adjusted 
to the lowest dose which controls symptoms.
Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Bronchodilators:
Ipratropium can provide short-term relief in chronic asthma, 
but short-acting β2-agonists work more quickly. Ipratropium 
is also used as a bronchodilator in chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease.

Related Drugs
24.1 Contraceptives 
24.1.1 Oral Hormonal Contraceptives
Hormonal contraception is one of the most effective methods 
of reversible fertility control.
Combined Oral Contraceptives:
Estrogen plus progestogen combinations are the most widely 
used hormonal contraceptives. They produce a contracep-
tive effect mainly by suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary 
system resulting in prevention of ovulation; in addition, 
changes in the endometrium make it unreceptive to implanta-
tion.
Endometrial proliferation is usually followed by thinning or 
regression of the endometrium resulting in reduced menstrual 
flow. Ovulation usually resumes within three menstrual cycles 
after oral contraception has been discontinued; anovulation 
and amenorrhoea persisting for six months or longer requires 
investigation and appropriate treatment if necessary.
Potential non-contraceptive benefits of combined oral contra-
ceptives include improved regularity of the menstrual cycle, 
decreased blood loss, less iron-deficiency anaemia and signifi-
cant decrease in dysmenorrhoea. Long-term use is associated 
with reduced risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer and of 
some pelvic infections.
An association between the amount of estrogen and 
progestogen in oral contraceptives and an increased risk of 
adverse cardiovascular effects has been observed. The use of 
oral contraceptive combinations containing the progestogens, 
desogestrel or gestodene are associated with a slightly 
increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with 
oral contraceptives containing the progestogens, levonorg-
estrel or norethisterone.
Risk Factors for Venous Thromboembolism or Arterial 
Disease:
Risk factors for venous thromboembolism include family 
history of venous thromboembolism in first-degree relative 
aged under 45 years, obesity, long-term immobilization and 
varicose veins.
Risk factors for arterial disease include family history of arterial 
460
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
disease in first-degree relative aged under 45 years, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, smoking, age over 35 years (avoid if 
over 50 years), obesity and migraine.
If any one of the factors is present, combined oral contra-
ceptives should be used with caution; if 2 or more factors 
for either venous thromboembolism or arterial disease are 
present, combined oral contraceptives should be avoided. 
Combined oral contraceptives are contraindicated in migraine 
with aura, in severe migraine without aura regularly lasting 
over 72 h despite treatment and in migraine treated with 
ergot derivatives.
Surgery:
Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives should preferably 
be discontinued (and adequate alternative contraceptive 
arrangements made) 4 weeks before major elective surgery 
and all surgery to the legs or surgery which involves prolonged 
immobilization of a lower limb. They should normally be 
restarted at the first menses occuring at least 2 weeks after 
full mobilization. When discontinuation is not possible throm-
boprophylaxis (with heparin and graduated compression 
hosiery) is advised.
Reasons to Stop Combined Oral Contraceptives 
Immediately:
Combined estrogen-containing oral contraceptives should 
be stopped immediately if any of the following symptoms 
occur and resumed only after consultation with a health care 
provider:
Sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left 
•	
arm);
Sudden breathlessness (or cough with blood-stained 
•	
sputum);
Severe pain in calf of one leg;
•	
Severe stomach pain;
•	
Serious neurological effects including unusual, severe, 
•	
prolonged headache especially if first time or getting 
progressively worse or sudden partial or complete loss of 
vision or sudden disturbance of hearing or other percep-
tual disorders or dysphagia or bad fainting attack or 
collapse or first unexplained epileptic seizure or weakness, 
motor disturbances, very marked numbness suddenly 
affecting one side or one part of body;
Hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement;
•	
Blood pressure above 160 mmHg systolic and 100 mmHg 
•	
diastolic;
Detection of 2 or more risk factors for venous thromboem-
•	
bolism or arterial disease, see notes above

Progestogen-Only Contraceptives:
Progestogen-only contraceptives, such as oral levonorgestrel 
may offer a suitable alternative when estrogens are contrain-
dicated but the oral progestogen-only preparations do not 
prevent ovulation in all cycles and have a higher failure rate than 
combined estrogen-containing preparations. Progestogen-
only contraceptives carry less risk of thromboembolic and 
cardiovascular disease than combined oral contraceptives and 
are preferable for women at increased risk of such complica-
tions, for example smokers over 35 years. They can be used as 
an alternative to estrogen-containing combined preparations 
prior to major surgery. Oral progestogen-only contraceptives 
may be started 3 weeks after birth; lactation women should 
preferably start at least 6 weeks after birth. Menstrual irregu-
larities (oligomenorrhoea, menorrhagia, amenorrhoea) are 
common. Injectable preparations of medroxyprogesterone 
acetate or norethisterone enantate may be given intramus-
cularly. They have prolonged action and should only be given 
with full counselling and manufacturer’s information leaflet.
Emergency Contraception:
Levonorgestrel is used for emergency contraception. Levonorg-
estrel 1.5 mg should be taken as a single dose within 72 h of 
unprotected intercourse; alternatively, levonorgestrel 750 µg 
can be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse followed 
12 h later by another 750 µg. Under these circumstances 
levonorgestrel prevents about 86% of pregnancies that would 
have occurred if no treatment had been given. Adverse effects 
include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, breast discom-
fort, and menstrual irregularities. If vomiting occurs within 2-3 
h of taking the tablets, replacement tablets can be given with 
an antiemetic.
It should be explained to the woman that her next period may 
be early or late; that she needs to use a barrier contracep-
tive method until her next period, and that she should return 
promptly if she has any lower abdominal pain or if the subse-
quent menstrual bleed is abnormally light, heavy, brief or 
absent. There is no evidence of harmful effects to the fetus if 
pregnancy should occur.

Each tablet (pill) should be taken at 
approximately the same time each day; if 
delayed by longer than 24 h contraceptive 
protection may be lost. It is important to 
bear in mind that the critical time for loss 
of protection is when a pill is omitted at the 
beginning or end of a cycle (which lengthens 
the pill-free interval).

24.1.3 Intrauterine Devices
Copper-bearing intrauterine contraceptive devices consist of 
a plastic carrier wound with copper wire or fitted with copper 
bands; some also have a central core of silver to prevent frag-
mentation of copper. Smaller devices have been introduced to 
minimize adverse effects and the replacement time for these 
devices is normally between 3 and 8 years. Fertility declines 
with age and therefore a copper intrauterine device fitted in 
a woman over 40 years of age, may remain in the uterus until 
menopause.
The intrauterine device is appropriate for women who expect 
to use it for continuous long-term contraception. It is suit-
able for older parous women; intrauterine devices should be 
used with caution in young nulliparous women because of the 
increased risk of expulsion. Young women at risk of sexually 
transmitted infections are also at risk of pelvic inflammatory 
disease.
The timing and technique of fitting an intrauterine device play 
a critical role in its subsequent performance and call for proper 
training and experience. Patients should receive full counsel-
ling backed by the manufacturer’s approved leaflet. For routine 
contraception the device can be inserted between 4 and 12 days 
after the start of menstruation; for emergency contraception 
the device can be inserted at any time in the menstrual cycle 
within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. There is an increased 
risk of infection for 20 days after insertion and this may be 
related to existing lower genital tract infection. Pre-screening 
(at least for chlamydia and gonorrhoea) should if possible be 
performed. If sustained pelvic or lower abdominal pain occur 
during the following 20 days after insertion of the device, the 
woman should be treated as having acute pelvic inflamma-
tory disease. An intrauterine device should not be removed in 
mid-cycle unless an additional contraceptive was used for the 
previous 7 days. If removal is essential (for example to treat 
severe pelvic infection) post-coital contraception should be 
considered. If the woman becomes pregnant, the device should 
be removed in the first trimester and the possibility of ectopic 
pregnancy considered; if the threads of the intrauterine device 
are already missing on presentation, the pregnancy is at risk 
of second trimester abortion, haemorrhage, pre-term delivery 
and infection.

Emergency Contraception:
Insertion of a copper intrauterine contraceptive device is a 
highly effective method of emergency contraception and is 
more effective than hormonal methods of emergency contra-
ception. Sexually transmitted diseases should be tested for 
and insertion of the device should usually be covered by anti-
bacterial prophylaxis.

24.1.4 Estrogens
Estrogens are necessary for the development of female 
secondary sexual characteristics; they also stimulate myome-
trial hypertrophy with endometrial hyperplasia. They affect 
bone by increasing calcium deposition. They are secreted 
at varying rates during the menstrual cycle throughout 
the period of activity of the ovaries. During pregnancy, the 
placenta becomes the main source of estrogens. At the meno-
pause, ovarian secretion declines at varying rates.
Estrogen therapy is given cyclically or continuously princi-
pally for contraception and for the alleviation of menopausal 
symptoms. If long-term therapy is required for menopausal 
hormone therapy a progestogen should be added to prevent 
cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (or of endometrial foci 
in women who have had a hysterectomy) and possible trans-
formation to cancer.
The palliative care of advanced inoperable, metastatic carci-
noma of the breast in both men and postmenopausal women 
is another indication for estrogen therapy.
470
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
Hormone Therapy (HT):
Estrogens are used for replacement therapy in perimenopausal 
and menopausal women for the treatment of vasomotor insta-
bility, vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with the meno-
pause and for the prevention of osteoporosis. HT should not 
be prescribed with the aim of reducing the incidence of heart 
disease. HT may be used for menopausal women whose lives 
are unduly inconvenienced by vaginal atrophy or vasomotor 
instability. Vaginal atrophy may respond to a short course of 
a vaginal estrogen preparation. Systemic treatment is needed 
for vasomotor and other symptoms of estrogen deficiency 
and can be given for up to 2-3 years;  Medroxyprogesterone 
acetate (see also chapter 21.4.2) may be given in a dose of 
10 mg daily for the last 12-14 days of each estrogen HT cycle. 
Alternatively, norethisterone 1 mg daily may be given on the 
last 12-14 days of each 28-day estrogen cycle.
HT should be considered for women with early natural or 
surgical menopause (before age 45 years) because they have 
a high risk of osteoporosis. Small doses of estrogen given 
systemically in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal 
period also diminish osteoporosis, but the slight increased 
risk of breast cancer needs to be taken into account. For early 
menopause, HT can be given until the approximate age of 
natural menopause (until age 50 years).
For longer-term use of HT in postmenopausal women (with a 
uterus or without a uterus), women must be made aware of 
the increased incidence of breast cancer and other adverse 
effects. Each decision to start HT should be made on an indi-
vidual basis, and treatment should be regularly reappraised 
(at least once a year). Factors such as corticosteroid therapy, 
family history of osteoporosis, thinness, lack of exercise, alco-
holism or smoking, early menopause, fractures to the hip or 
forearm before age 65 years should be taken into account 
when considering the use of HT; women of African origin 
appear to be less susceptible to osteoporosis than those who 
are white or of Asian origin.
There is an increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis and of 
pulmonary embolism in women taking HT. In women who 
have predisposing factors such as a personal or family history 
of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, severe 
varicose veins, obesity, surgery, trauma or prolonged bed-
rest, the overall risk may outweigh the benefit.
Using HT increases the risk of breast cancer slightly. The 
increased risk is related to the duration of HT use and this 
excess risk disappears within about 5 years of stopping. The 
risk of breast cancer is greater with combined HT (an estrogen 
471
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
and a progestogen) than with estrogen-only HT (but estrogen 
alone may not be suitable for women with intact uterus).
Epidemiological studies indicate that in women aged between 
50 and 65 years not using HT, about 32 cases of breast cancer 
will be diagnosed in every 1000 women. In those using HT, the 
risk of breast cancer is increased as follows: 
Women using 
•	
combined HT with an estrogen and a 
progestogen for 5 years, about 6 additional cases in 
1000; in those using combined HT for 10 years, about 
19 additional cases in 1000
Women using 
•	
estrogen-only HT for 5 years, about 2 
additional cases in 1000; in those using estrogen-only 
HT for 10 years, about 5 additional cases in 1000.
HT does not provide contraception. If a potentially fertile 
woman needs to use HT, non-hormonal contraceptive meas-
ures are necessary.
Precautions for patients on HT undergoing surgery and reasons 
to stop HT are the same as those for hormonal contraceptives.

24.2 Hormones
24.2.1 Adrenal Hormones and synthetic Substitutes
Corticosteroids include hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex 
and synthetic analogues of these hormones. The adrenal cortex 
normally secretes hydrocortisone which has glucocorticoid 
activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. It also secretes the 
mineralocorticoid aldosterone. Synthetic glucocorticoids include 
betamethasone, dexamethasone and prednisolone. Fludrocorti-
sone has glucocorticoid properties but it has potent mineralocor-
ticoid properties and is used for its mineralocorticoid effects.
Pharmacology of the corticosteroids is complex and their actions 
are wide-ranging. In physiological (low) doses, they replace defi-
cient endogenous hormones. In pharmacological (high) doses, 
glucocorticoids decrease inflammation and suppress the immune 
response.
In therapeutic doses glucocorticoids suppress release of corti-
cotrophin (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, ACTH) from the 
pituitary thus the adrenal cortex ceases secretion of endog-
enous corticosteroids. If suppressive doses are given for 
prolonged periods, the adrenal cortex may undergo atrophy 
and this leads to a deficiency on sudden withdrawal or dosage 
reduction or situations such as stress or trauma where corti-
costeroid requirements are increased. After high dosage or 
prolonged therapy, withdrawal should be gradual, the rate 
depending on various factors including patient response, 
corticosteroid dose, duration of treatment and disease state. 
The suppressive action of a corticosteroid on cortisol secre-
tion is least when given in the morning. Corticosteroids should 
normally be given in a single morning dose to attempt to mini-
mize pituitary-adrenal suppression. Because the therapeutic 
effects of corticosteroids are of longer duration than the 
metabolic effects, intermittent therapy may allow the body’s 
normal metabolic rhythm and the therapeutic effects to be 
maintained. Alternate day dosing is, however, suitable only 
in certain disease states and with corticosteroids with small 
mineralocorticoid effects and a relatively short duration of 
action.
Hydrocortisone is used in adrenal replacement therapy and 
on a short-term basis by intravenous injection for the emer-
gency management of some conditions. Its mineralocorticoid 
activity is too high for it to be used on a long-term basis for 
disease suppression. The mineralocorticoid activity of fludro-
cortisone is also high and its anti-inflammatory activity is of no 
clinical relevance. It is used together with glucocorticoids in 
adrenal insufficiency. Prednisolone has predominantly gluco-
475
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
corticoid activity and is the corticosteroid most commonly 
administered for long-term disease suppression. It is the 
active metabolite of prednisone, conversion of which is vari-
able and prednisone should not be used interchangeably with 
prednisolone. Dexamethasone has very high glucocorticoid 
activity in conjunction with insignificant mineralocorticoid 
activity making it particularly suitable for high-dose therapy 
in conditions where water retention would be a disadvantage 
such as cerebral oedema. It also has a long duration of action 
and this, together with its lack of mineralocorticoid activity 
makes it particularly suitable for conditions requiring suppres-
sion of corticotrophin secretion such as congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia.
Adverse Effects of Corticosteroids:
Overdosage or prolonged use may exaggerate some of the 
normal physiological actions of corticosteroids leading to 
mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid adverse effects.
Mineralocorticoid adverse effects include hypertension, 
sodium and water retention and potassium loss. These effects 
are most marked with fludrocortisone but are significant with 
hydrocortisone, occur slightly with prednisolone and are 
negligible with dexamethasone.
Glucocorticoid adverse effects include diabetes mellitus and 
osteoporosis which is of particular importance in the elderly 
since it may result in osteoporotic fractures of the hip or 
vertebrae. High doses may also be associated with avascular 
necrosis of the femoral neck. Muscle wasting may also occur 
and there is a weak link with peptic ulceration. Mental distur-
bances can occur, including serious paranoid state or depres-
sion with risk of suicide, particularly in patients with a history 
of mental disorders; euphoria is also common. High doses 
may cause Cushing syndrome (typical moon face, striae and 
acne), which is usually reversible on withdrawal of treatment, 
but this should always be tapered gradually to avoid symp-
toms of acute adrenal insufficiency (see also Withdrawal). In 
children, corticosteroids may result in suppression of growth 
and corticosteroids administered during pregnancy can affect 
adrenal development in the fetus. Any adrenal suppression 
in the neonate following prenatal exposure usually resolves 
spontaneously after birth and is rarely, clinically important. 
Healing of wounds may be impaired and infections and thin-
ning of the skin may occur; spread of infections may result 
from modification of tissue reactions.
Adrenal Suppression
Adrenal suppression occurs during prolonged therapy with 
corticosteroids, with development of adrenal atrophy which 
476
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
may persist for years after stopping. Abrupt withdrawal after 
a prolonged period may lead to acute adrenal insufficiency, 
hypotension or death (see Withdrawal of Systemic Corti-
costeroids, below). Withdrawal may also be associated with 
fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, painful itchy 
skin nodules and weight loss.
Corticosteroid Cover During Stress:
To compensate for a diminished adrenocortical response 
caused by prolonged corticosteroid treatment, any significant 
intercurrent illness, trauma, or surgery requires a temporary 
increase in corticosteroid dose, or if already stopped, a tempo-
rary re-introduction of corticosteroid treatment. Anaesthetists 
must therefore know whether a patient is taking or has been 
taking a corticosteroid, to avoid a precipitous fall in blood pres-
sure during anaesthesia or in the immediate postoperative 
period. A suitable regimen for corticosteroid replacement, in 
patients who have taken more than 10 mg prednisolone daily 
(or equivalent) within 3 months of surgery, is: 
Minor surgery under general anaesthesia
•	
-usual oral 
corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery or 
hydrocortisone 25-50 mg intravenously at induction; 
the usual oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced 
after surgery.
Moderate or major surgery
•	
-usual oral corticosteroid 
dose on the morning of surgery and hydrocortisone 
25-50 mg intravenously at induction, followed by 
hydrocortisone 25-50 mg 3 times a day by intrave-
nous injection for 24 h after moderate surgery or for 
48-72 h after major surgery; the usual preoperative 
oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced on stopping 
hydrocortisone injections.
Infections:
Prolonged courses of corticosteroids increase susceptibility to 
infections and increase their severity; clinical presentation of 
infections may also be atypical. Serious infections, for example 
septicaemia and tuberculosis, may reach an advanced stage 
before being recognised, and amoebiasis or strongyloidiasis 
may be activated or exacerbated (exclude before initiating a 
corticosteroid in those at risk or with suggestive symptoms). 
Fungal or viral ocular infections may also be exacerbated.
Chickenpox
Unless they have had chickenpox, patients receiving oral or 
parenteral corticosteroids for purposes other than replace-
ment should be regarded as being at risk of severe chickenpox 
on exposure. Manifestations of fulminant illness include pneu-
monia, hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation; 
477
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
rash is not necessarily a prominent feature.
Passive immunization with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin is 
needed for exposed non-immune patients receiving systemic 
corticosteroids or for those who have used them within the 
previous 3 months; varicella-zoster immunoglobulin should 
preferably be given within 3 days of exposure and no later 
than 10 days. Confirmed chickenpox warrants specialist care 
and urgent treatment. Corticosteroids should not be stopped 
and dosage may need to be increased.
Topical, inhaled or rectal corticosteroids are less likely to be 
associated with an increased risk of severe chickenpox.
Measles
Patients taking corticosteroids should be advised to take 
particular care to avoid exposure to measles and to seek 
immediate medical advice if exposure occurs. Prophylaxis 
with intramuscular normal immunoglobulin may be needed.
Dosage and Administration:
Adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids, including suppres-
sion of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, are dose- 
and duration-dependent; thus patients should be given treat-
ment for the shortest period at the lowest dose that is clinically 
necessary. Patient response is variable and doses should there-
fore be individualized. In life-threatening diseases, high doses 
may be needed because the complications of therapy are likely 
to be less serious than the disease. In long-term therapy in rela-
tively benign chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
adverse effects often outweigh the advantages. In order to 
minimize the adverse effects, the maintenance dose should be 
kept as low as possible and if possible, single morning doses 
or alternate day therapy should be used. Glucocorticoids can 
improve the prognosis of serious conditions such as systemic 
lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis and polyarteritis 
nodosa; in such disorders the effects of the disease process 
may be suppressed and symptoms relieved but the underlying 
condition is not cured.
Glucocorticoids are used both topically and systemically. In 
emergency situations, hydrocortisone may be given intrave-
nously; in the treatment of asthma, inhalation therapy with 
beclomethasone may be used (chapter 20.1). Whenever 
possible, local treatment with creams, intra-articular injec-
tions, inhalations, eye-drops or enemas should be used in 
preference to systemic therapy.
Withdrawal of Systemic Corticosteroids:
The rate of withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids is 
dependent upon several factors including size of dose, dura-
478
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
tion of treatment, individual patient’s response and the likeli-
hood of relapse of the underlying disease. If there is uncer-
tainty about suppression of the HPA axis, withdrawal should 
be gradual to enable the adrenal gland to recover. Patients 
should be advised not to stop taking glucocorticoids abruptly 
unless permitted by their doctor.
Gradual withdrawal should be considered in those whose 
disease is unlikely to relapse and who have:
recently received repeated courses (particularly if 
•	
taken for longer than 3 weeks)
taken a short course within 1 year of stopping long-
•	
term therapy
other possible causes of adrenal suppression
•	
received more than 40 mg daily prednisolone 
•	
(or equivalent)
been given repeat doses in the evening
•	
received more than 3 weeks’ treatment
•	
Abrupt withdrawal may be considered in those whose disease 
is unlikely to relapse and who have received treatment for 3 
weeks or less and who are not included in the patient groups 
described above.
During corticosteroid withdrawal the dose may be reduced 
rapidly down to the physiological dosage (equivalent to 7.5 
mg prednisolone daily) and then reduced more slowly. Assess-
ment of the disease may be needed during withdrawal to 
ensure that relapse does not occur.

24.2.2 Androgens
Androgens are secreted by the testes and weaker androgens by 
the adrenal cortex and ovaries. In the male, they are respon-
sible for the development and maintenance of the sex organs 
and the secondary sexual characteristics, normal reproduc-
tive function, and sexual performance ability in addition to 
stimulating the growth and development of the skeleton and 
skeletal muscle during puberty. At high doses in the normal 
male androgens inhibit pituitary gonadotrophin secretion and 
depress spermatogenesis. Testosterone is used as replacement 
therapy in those who are hypogonadal due to either pitui-
tary (secondary hypogonadism) or testicular disease (primary 
hypogonadism). Androgens are useless as a treatment of impo-
tence and impaired spermatogenesis unless there is associated 
hypogonadism; they should not be given until the hypogo-
nadism has been properly investigated and treatment should 
always be under expert supervision. When given to patients 
with hypopituitarism they can lead to normal sexual develop-
ment and potency but not fertility. If fertility is desired, the 
usual treatment is with gonadotrophins or pulsatile gonado-
trophin-releasing hormone which will stimulate spermatogen-
esis as well as androgen production. Androgens cannot induce 
fertility in men with primary hypogonadism. Caution should be 
used in treating boys with delayed puberty with excessive doses 
of testosterone since the fusion of epiphyses is hastened and 
may result in short stature. Androgens, including testosterone 
have also been used in postmenopausal women for the pallia-
tive treatment of androgen-responsive, advanced, metastatic 
breast cancer; care is required to prevent masculinizing effects.

24.3 Insulin and Other Anti-Diabetic Agents
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycaemia and distur-
bances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. There are 
2 principal types of diabetes.
Type-1 diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is due 
to a deficiency of insulin caused by autoimmune destruction of 
pancreatic β-cells. Patients require administration of insulin.
Type-2 diabetes or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is 
due to reduced secretion of insulin or to peripheral resistance to 
the action of insulin. Patients may be controlled by diet alone, 
but often require administration of oral antidiabetic drugs or 
insulin. The energy and carbohydrate intake must be adequate 
but obesity should be avoided. In type 2 diabetes, obesity is one 
of the factors associated with insulin resistance. Diets high in 
complex carbohydrate and fibre and low in fat are beneficial. 
Emphasis should be placed on exercise and increased activity.
The aim of treatment is to achieve the best possible control of 
plasma glucose concentration and prevent or minimize compli-
cations including microvascular complications (retinopathy, 
albuminuria, neuropathy). Diabetes mellitus is a strong risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease; other risk factors such as 
smoking, hypertension, obesity and hyperlipidaemia should 
also be addressed.
Insulin
Appropriate insulin regimens should be worked out for each 
patient. Insulin requirements may be affected by variations 
in lifestyle (diet and exercise)-drugs such as corticosteroids, 
infections, stress, accidental or surgical trauma, puberty and 
pregnancy (second and third trimesters) may increase insulin 
requirements; renal or hepatic impairment and some endocrine 
disorders (for example Addison’s disease, hypopituitarism) or 
coelic disease may reduce requirements. In pregnancy insulin 
requirements should be monitored frequently.
If possible patients should monitor their own blood-glucose 
concentration using blood glucose strips. Since blood-glucose 
concentration varies throughout the day, patients should aim 
to maintain blood-glucose concentration between 4 and 9 
mmol/litre (4-7 mmol/L before meals, <9 mmol/L) for most 
of the day while accepting that on occasions it will be higher; 
strenuous efforts should be made to prevent blood-glucose 
concentrations falling below 4 mmol/litre because of the 
risk of hypoglycaemia. Patients should be advised to look 
for troughs and peaks of blood glucose and to adjust their 
insulin dosage only once or twice a week. Insulin doses are 
486
NFI-2011

determined on an individual basis, by gradually increasing the 
dose to optimise blood-glucose concentration while avoiding 
hypoglycaemia.
In the absence of blood-glucose monitoring strips, urine-glu-
cose monitoring strips can be used; in fact this is the method of 
personal choice for many patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
It is less reliable than blood glucose but is easier and costs much 
less. All patients should monitor either blood- or urine-glucose 
concentration daily.
Hypoglycaemia is a potential complication in all patients treated 
with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents. The consequences of 
hypoglycaemia include confusion, seizures, coma and cerebral 
infarction.
Loss of warning of hypoglycaemia is common among insulin-
treated patients and can be a serious hazard especially for 
drivers and those in dangerous occupations. Very tight control 
lowers the blood glucose concentration needed to trigger 
hypoglycaemic symptoms; increase in the frequency of hypogly-
caemic episodes reduces the warning symptoms experienced 
by patients. Beta-blockers can also blunt hypoglycaemic aware-
ness (and delay recovery). Some patients report loss of hypogly-
caemic warning after transfer to human insulin. Clinical studies 
do not confirm that human insulin decreases hypoglycaemic 
awareness. If a patient believes that human insulin is responsible 
for loss of warning it is reasonable to revert to animal insulin. 
To restore warning signs, episodes of hypoglycaemia must be 
reduced to a minimum; this involves appropriate adjustment of 
insulin dose and frequency, and suitable timing and quantity of 
meals and snacks. 
Drivers need to be particularly careful to avoid hypoglycaemia. 
They should check their blood-glucose concentration before 
driving and, on long journeys, at intervals of approximately two 
hour; they should ensure that a supply of sugar is always readily 
available. If hypoglycaemia occurs, the driver should stop the 
vehicle in a safe place, ingest a suitable sugar supply and wait 
until recovery is complete (may be 15 min or longer). Driving 
is particularly hazardous when hypoglycaemic awareness is 
impaired.
For sporadic physical activity, extra carbohydrate may need 
to be taken to avert hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose should be 
monitored before, during and after exercise. Hypoglycaemia can 
develop in patients taking oral antidiabetics, notably the sulfo-
nylureas, but this is uncommon and usually indicates excessive 
dosage. Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia may persist for 
several hour and must be treated in hospital.
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a potentially lethal condition caused by 
487
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
an absolute or relative lack of insulin; it commonly occurs when 
adjustments to insulin dosage fail to compensate for increases 
in insulin requirements, for example during severe infection or 
major intercurrent illness. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs mostly 
in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. It also occurs in Type 
2 diabetics who have a temporary need for insulin. Diabetic 
ketoacidosis is characterized by hyperglycaemia, hyperketo-
naemia and acidaemia with dehydration and electrolyte distur-
bances. It is essential that soluble insulin (and intravenous fluids) 
is readily available for its treatment.
Infections are more likely to develop in patients with poorly 
controlled diabetes mellitus. These should be treated promptly 
and effectively to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis.
Surgery: Particular attention should be paid to insulin require-
ments when a patient with diabetes undergoes surgery that 
is likely to need an intravenous infusion of insulin for longer 
than 12 h. Soluble insulin should be given in intravenous infu-
sion of glucose and potassium chloride (provided the patient 
is not hyperkalaemic), and adjusted to provide a blood-glucose 
concentration of between 7 and 12 mmol/litre. The duration 
of action of intravenous insulin is only a few min therefore 
the infusion must not be stopped unless the patient becomes 
frankly hypoglycaemic. For non-insulin dependent diabetics, 
insulin treatment is almost always required during surgery (oral 
hypoglycaemic drugs having been omitted).
Insulin must be given by injection because it is inactivated by 
gastrointestinal enzymes. Generally, insulin is given by subcu-
taneous injection into the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or 
abdomen. There may be increased absorption from a limb, if 
the limb is used in strenuous exercise following the injection. 
It is essential to use only syringes calibrated for the particular 
concentration of insulin administered.
There are three main types of insulin preparations, classified 
according to duration of action after subcutaneous injection:
those of short duration which have a relatively rapid 
•	
onset of action, for example soluble or neutral insulin;
those with an intermediate action, for example isophane 
•	
insulin and insulin zinc suspension;
those with a relatively slow onset and long duration of 
•	
action, for example crystalline insulin zinc suspension.
Soluble insulin, when injected subcutaneously, has a rapid 
onset of action (after 30-60 min), a peak action between 2 and 
4 h, and a duration of action up to 8 h. Soluble insulin by the 
intravenous route is reserved for urgent treatment and fine 
control in serious illness and perioperative state. When injected 
488
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
intravenously, soluble insulin has a very short half-life of only 
about 5 min.
When injected subcutaneously, intermediate-acting insulins 
have an onset of action of approximately 1-2 h, a maximal effect 
at 4-12 h and a duration of action of 16-24 h. They can be given 
twice daily together with short-acting insulin or once daily, 
particularly in elderly patients. They can be mixed with soluble 
insulin in the syringe, essentially retaining properties of each 
component.
The duration of action of different insulin preparations varies 
considerably from one patient to another and this needs to be 
assessed for every individual. The type of insulin used and its 
dose and frequency of administration depend on the needs of 
each patient. For patients with acute onset diabetes mellitus, 
treatment should be started with soluble insulin given 3 times 
daily with medium-acting insulin at bedtime. For those less seri-
ously ill, treatment is usually started with a mixture of pre-mixed 
short- and medium-acting insulins (for example 30% soluble 
insulin with 70% isophane insulin) given twice daily. The propor-
tions of soluble insulin can be increased in patients with exces-
sive post-prandial hyperglycaemia.
Oral Antidiabetic Drugs
Oral antidiabetic (hypoglycaemic) drugs are used for non-insu-
lin-dependent diabetes mellitus in patients who do not respond 
to dietary adjustment and an increase in physical exercise. They 
are used to supplement the effect of diet and exercise. There are 
various types of oral antidiabetic agents. The most commonly 
used are the sulfonylureas and the biguanide, metformin.
Sulfonylureas act mainly by augmenting insulin secretion and 
are therefore only effective if there is some residual pancreatic 
beta-cell activity. They may occasionally lead to hypoglycaemia 
4 h or more after food. This may be dose-related and usually 
indicates excessive dose and it occurs more frequently with 
long-acting sulfonylureas such as glibenclamide and occurs 
particularly in the elderly. The sulfonylureas have the disad-
vantage that they may encourage weight gain. They should not 
be used during lactation and caution is required in the elderly 
and those with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of the risk 
of hypoglycaemia. Insulin therapy is generally required during 
intercurrent illness such as myocardial infarction, coma, infec-
tion, and trauma, during surgery and also during pregnancy.
Metformin exerts its effect by decreasing gluconeogenesis 
and by increasing peripheral utilization of glucose. Metformin 
can only act in the presence of endogenous insulin therefore 
is effective only in diabetics with some residual functioning 
pancreatic islet cells. It is used as a first-line treatment in over-
489
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
weight non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients and in others 
when strict dieting and sulfonylureas have failed to control the 
disease. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are common on initial 
treatment and may persist, particularly when very high doses 
(such as 3g daily) are given. In order to reduce gastrointestinal 
effects, treatment should be initiated with a low dose which may 
be gradually increased. Metformin may provoke lactic acidosis 
which is most likely to occur in patients with renal impairment; it 
should not be used in patients with even mild renal impairment. 
One major advantage of metformin is that it does not usually 
cause hypoglycaemia. It may be used together with insulin 
(but weight gain and hypoglycaemia can be problem) or sulfo-
nylureas (but possibility of increased adverse effects with such 
combinations). During medical and surgical emergencies insulin 
treatment is almost always required; insulin should be substi-
tuted for metformin before elective surgery and in pregnancy.

24.4 Ovulation Inducers and Progestogens
24.4.1 Drugs for Ovulation Induction
The anti-estrogen, clomifene is used in the treatment of 
female infertility due to disturbances in ovulation. It induces 
gonadotrophin release by occupying estrogen receptors in 
the hypothalamus, thereby interfering with feedback mecha-
nisms. Patients should be carefully counselled and should be 
fully aware of the potential adverse effects, including a risk 
of multiple pregnancy (rarely, more than twins), of this treat-
ment. Most patients who are going to respond will do so to 
the first course; 3 courses should be adequate; long-term 
cyclical therapy (more than 6 cycles) is not recommended as it 
may increase risk of ovarian cancer.

24.4.2 Progestogens
Progesterone is a hormone secreted by the corpus luteum 
whose actions include induction of secretory changes in 
the endometrium, relaxation of uterine smooth muscle and 
production of changes in the vaginal epithelium. Proges-
terone is relatively inactive following oral administration and 
produces local reactions at site of injection. This has led to the 
development of synthetic progestogens including levonorg-
estrel, norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone. Where 
endometriosis requires drug treatment, it may respond to 
synthetic progestogens on a continuous basis. They may also 
be used for the treatment of severe dysmenorrhoea. In post-
menopausal women receiving long-term estrogen therapy for 
hormone replacement, a progestogen needs to be added for 
women with an intact uterus to prevent hyperplasia of the 
endometrium.
Progestogens are also used in combined oral contraceptives 
and progestogen-only contraceptives.

24.5 Oxytocics and Antioxytocics
Drugs may be used to modify uterine contractions. These 
include oxytocic drugs used to stimulate uterine contractions 
both in induction of labour and to control postpartum haem-
orrhage and β2-adrenoceptor agonists used to relax the uterus 
and prevent premature labour.
Postpartum Haemorrhage:
Ergometrine and oxytocin differ in their actions on the uterus. 
In moderate doses oxytocin produces slow generalized contrac-
tions with full relaxation in between; ergometrine produces 
faster contractions superimposed on a tonic contraction. High 
doses of both substances produce sustained tonic contractions. 
Oxytocin is now recommended for routine use in postpartum 
and post-abortion haemorrhage since it is more stable than 
ergometrine. However, ergometrine may be used if oxytocin is 
not available or in emergency situations.
Premature Labour:
Salbutamol is a β2 -adrenoceptor agonist which relaxes the uterus 
and can be used to prevent premature labour in uncomplicated 
cases between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. Its main purpose is 
to permit a delay in delivery of at least 48 h. The greatest benefit 
is obtained by using this delay to administer corticosteroid 
therapy or to implement other measures known to improve 
perinatal health. Prolonged therapy should be avoided since the 
risk to the mother increases after 48 h and the response of the 
myometrium is reduced.

24.6 Thyroid Hormones and Antithyroid Drugs
Thyroid Drugs:
Thyroid agents are natural or synthetic agents containing 
levothyroxine (thyroxine) or liothyronine (tri-iodothyronine). 
The principal effect is to increase the metabolic rate. They 
also exert a cardiostimulatory effect which may be the result 
of a direct action on the heart. Thyroid hormones are used 
in hypothyroidism (myxoedema) and also in diffuse non-toxic 
goitre, Hashimoto thyroiditis (lymphadenoid goitre) and 
thyroid carcinoma. Neonatal hypothyroidism requires prompt 
treatment for normal development.
Levothyroxine Sodium (thyroxine Sodium) is the treatment 
of choice for maintenance therapy. It is almost completely 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but the full effects 
are not seen for up to 1 to 3 weeks after beginning therapy; 
there is a slow response to dose change and effects may 
persist for several weeks after withdrawal. Dosage of levothy-
roxine in infants and children for congenital hypothyroidism 
and juvenile myxoedema should be titrated according to 
clinical response, growth assessment and measurement of 
plasma thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone.
Antithyroid Drugs:
Antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil and carbimazole are 
used in the management of thyrotoxicosis. They are also used 
to prepare the patient for thyroidectomy. They are usually well-
tolerated, with mild leukopenia or rashes developing in a few 
percent of cases, usually during the first 6-8 weeks of therapy. 
During this time the blood count should be checked every 2 
weeks or if a sore throat or other signs of infection develop. 
The drugs are generally given in a high dose in the first instance 
until the patient becomes euthyroid, the dose may then be 
gradually reduced to a maintenance dose which is continued 
for 12-18 months, followed by monitoring to identify relapse. 
There is a lag time of some 2 weeks between the achievement 
of biochemical euthyroidism and clinical euthyroidism. Beta-
adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) (usually propranolol) 
may be used as a short-term adjunct to antithyroid drugs to 
control symptoms but their use in heart failure associated with 
thyrotoxicosis is controversial. Treatment can be given, if neces-
sary, in pregnancy but antithyroid drugs cross the placenta and 
in high doses may cause fetal goitre and hypothyroidism. The 
lowest dose that will control the hyperthyroid state should be 
used (requirements in Graves disease tend to fall during preg-
nancy). Propylthiouracil appears in breast milk but does not 
505
NFI-2011
Hormones, Contraceptives and Related Drugs
preclude lactation as long as neonatal development is closely 
monitored and the lowest effective dose is used.
If surgery (partial thyroidectomy) is contemplated, it may 
be necessary to give iodine for 10 to 14 days in addition to 
antithyroid drugs to assist control and reduce vascularity of 
the thyroid. Iodine should not be used for long-term treat-
ment since its antithyroid action tends to diminish. In patients 
in whom drug therapy fails to achieve long-term remissions 
definitive treatment with surgery or (increasingly) radioactive 
iodine is preferable.

28.1 Antianxiety Agents and Drugs Used In 
Sleep Disorders
A sedative drug decreases activity, moderates excite-
ment and calms the recipient, whereas, a hypnotic drug 
produces drowsiness and  facilitates  the onset   and main-
tenance of a sleep state  that resembles natural sleep. The 
most widely used anxiolytics and hypnotics are the benzo-
diazepines. Treatment of anxiety should be limited to the 
lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. The 
cause of insomnia should be established and appropriate 
treatment for underlying factors instituted before hypno-
tics are considered. Hypnotics may be of value for a few 
days but rarely, longer than a week.
Tolerance and dependence (both physical and psychological) 
and subsequent difficulty in withdrawing the drug may occur 
after regular use for more than a few weeks. Patients with 
chronic anxiety, alcohol or drug dependence or those with 
personality disorders are more likely to become dependent. 
Anxiolytics and hypnotics should be prescribed in carefully 
individualized dosage and use should be limited to control of 
acute conditions such as panic attacks and acute anxiety and 
severe, incapacitating insomnia. There is usually no justifica-
tion for prolonging treatment with anxiolytics and hypnotics 
for more than one to two weeks.
If used for longer periods, withdrawal should be gradual by 
reduction of the dose over a period of weeks or months, 
as abrupt discontinuation may produce confusion, toxic 
psychosis, convulsions or a condition resembling delirium 
tremens. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome may 
develop at any time up to 3 weeks after stopping a long-
acting benzodiazepine but may occur within a few hour in 
the case of a short-acting one. The syndrome is character-
ized by insomnia, anxiety, loss of appetite and body-weight, 
tremor, perspiration, tinnitus and perceptual disturbances. 
These symptoms may be similar to the original complaint and 
encourage further prescribing. Some symptoms may continue 
for weeks or months after stopping benzodiazepines.
Patients should be warned that their ability to drive or operate 
machinery may be impaired and that the effects of alcohol 
may be enhanced.

28.2 Antidepressants
Tricyclic and related antidepressants and the more recently 
introduced selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are 
the most widely used drugs in the treatment of depressive 
disorders. The response to antidepressant therapy is usually 
delayed with a lag-period of up to two weeks and at least six 
weeks before max. improvement occurs. It is important to use 
doses that are sufficiently high for effective treatment, but not 
so high as to cause toxic effects. Low doses should be used for 
initial treatment in the elderly. The use of more than one anti-
depressant at a time is not recommended since this does not 
enhance effectiveness and it may result in enhanced adverse 
effects or interactions. 
Patients should be reviewed every 1-2 weeks at the start of 
treatment. Treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks 
(6 weeks in the elderly) before considering whether to change 
to another antidepressant due to lack of efficacy. In the case of 
a partial response, treatment may be continued for a further 2 
weeks (elderly patients may take longer to respond). Remission 
usually occurs after 3-12 months. Treatment at full therapeutic 
dose should be continued for at least 4-6 months after resolu-
tion of symptoms (about 12 months in the elderly). Treatment 
should not be withdrawn prematurely otherwise symptoms 
are likely to recur. Patients with a history of recurrent depres-
sion should continue to receive maintenance treatment (for at 
least 5 years and possibly indefinitely). Lithium may be used as 
an alternative for maintenance treatment. Reduction in dose 
should be gradually carried out over a period of about 4 weeks 
or longer if withdrawal symptoms emerge (6 months in patients 
who have been on long-term maintenance treatment).
Tricyclic and related antidepressants can be divided into 
those with more or less sedative effect. Those with sedative 
properties include amitriptyline and those with less sedative 
effects include imipramine. These drugs are most effective in 
the treatment of depression associated with psychomotor 
and physiological disturbances. Adverse effects include anti-
cholinergic (more correctly antimuscarinic) symptoms of dry 
mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention. 
Arrhythmias and heart block can occur. Minimal quantities of 
tricyclic antidepressants should be prescribed at any one time 
because they are dangerous in overdose.
The SSRIs characteristically cause gastrointestinal distur-
bances, sleep disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions 
including rash (may be a sign of an impending serious systemic 
reaction and discontinuation should be considered) but they 
are less sedating and have fewer anticholinergic (antimus-
carinic) and cardiotoxic effects than tricyclic antidepressants. 
The SSRIs are less toxic in overdose than the older tricyclic

compounds. They may be preferred in patients in whom the 
risk of suicide is strong, but there is some concern that SSRIs 
may increase suicidal ideation.

Dose
Oral
20 mg/day initially (max 60 mg).
Contraindications 
Should not be used if the patient enters a 
manic phase; renal failure, hypersensitivity.
Precautions 
Should be used with caution in patients 
with epilepsy (avoid if poorly controlled, 
discontinue if convulsions develop), cardiac 
disease, diabetes mellitus, susceptibility to

with caution in those receiving concurrent 
electroconvulsive 
therapy 
(prolonged 
seizures reported with fluoxetine). The risk 
of suicidal behaviour is possibly higher in 
young adults, calling for close monitoring of 
those receiving SSRIs. SSRIs may also impair 
performance of skilled tasks (e.g. driving),

dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, consti-
pation), anorexia with weight loss (increased 
appetite and weight gain also reported) and 
hypersensitivity reactions including rash 
(consider discontinuation-may be sign of 
impending serious systemic reaction, pos-
sibly associated with vasculitis), urticaria,

28.3 Antipsychotics
Treatment of psychotic disorders is both pharmacological 
and psychosocial. Individual and community programmes 
for relearning old skills and developing new ones and for 
learning to cope with the illness should be initiated. Classes 
of antipsychotic drugs include phenothiazines (for example 
chlorpromazine), butyrophenones (for example haloperidol), 
thioxanthenes (for example flupentixol) and newer ‘atypical’ 
neuroleptics including clozapine and risperidone. The various 
antipsychotic drugs do not, in general, differ in their antip-
sychotic activity, but differ in range and quality of adverse 
effects (see below).
Acute Phase Treatment:
The administration of chlorpromazine or haloperidol will 
relieve symptoms such as thought disorder, hallucinations 
and delusions and prevent relapse. They are usually less effec-
tive in apathetic, withdrawn patients. However, haloperidol 
may restore an acutely ill schizophrenic, who was previously 
withdrawn, or even mute and akinetic, to normal activity and 
social behaviour. In the acute phase chlorpromazine may be 
administered by intramuscular injection in a dose of 25-50 
mg which can be repeated every 6-8 h while observing the 
patient for possible hypotension. In most cases, however, 
the intramuscular injection is not needed and patients can 
be treated with an oral dose. Haloperidol may be adminis-
tered in the acute phase.
Maintenance Therapy:
Long-term treatment in patients with a definite diagnosis 
of schizophrenia may be necessary after the first episode to 
prevent the manifest illness from becoming chronic.
The lowest possible dose of antipsychotic drug that will 
prevent major exacerbations of florid symptoms is used for 
long-term management. Too rapid a dose reduction should 
be avoided. Intramuscular depot preparations such as 
fluphenazine may be used as an alternative to oral mainte-
nance therapy especially when compliance with oral treat-
ment is unreliable. Exacerbations of illness in patients on 
maintenance drug therapy can be precipitated by stress.
Withdrawal of maintenance drug treatment requires careful 
surveillance since it is not possible to predict the course of the 
disease and the patient may suffer a relapse if treatment is 
withdrawn inappropriately. Further, the need for continuation 
of treatment may not be evident on withdrawal of treatment 
because relapse may be delayed for several weeks.

Adverse Effects
They are very common with long-term administration of antip-
sychotic drugs. Hypotension and interference with tempera-
ture regulation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and bone-
marrow depression are the most life-threatening. Hypoten-
sion and interference with temperature regulation are dose-
related. They can result in dangerous falls and hypothermia 
in the elderly and this must be considered before prescribing 
these drugs for patients over 70 years of age. 
Extrapyramidal symptoms are the most troublesome and are 
caused most frequently by the piperazine phenothiazines such 
as fluphenazine, the butyrophenones such as haloperidol and 
the depot preparations. Although easily recognized, they are 
not so easy to predict because they depend in part on the dose 
and patient susceptibility as well as the type of drug. However, 
there is a general tendency for low-potency drugs to have less 
extrapyramidal adverse effects, while high-potency drugs such 
as haloperidol have more extrapyramidal effects but less seda-
tion and anticholinergic (more correctly antimuscarinic) effects. 
Sedation and anticholinergic effects usually diminish with 
continued use. Extrapyramidal symptoms consist of parkin-
sonian-type symptoms including tremor which may occur 
gradually; dystonia (abnormal face and body movements) and 
dyskinesia, which may appear after only a few doses; akathisia 
(restlessness), which may occur after large initial doses and 
may resemble an exacerbation of the condition being treated; 
and tardive dyskinesia (an orofacial dyskinesia), which usually 
takes longer to develop but may develop on short-term treat-
ment with low doses; short-lived tardive dyskinesia may 
occur after withdrawal of the drug. Parkinsonian symptoms 
are usually reversible on withdrawal of the drug and may be 
suppressed by anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) drugs but they 
may unmask or worsen tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is 
usually associated with long-term treatment and high dosage 
of an antipsychotic, particularly in elderly patients. There is no 
established treatment for tardive dyskinesias, which may be 
irreversible on withdrawing therapy. However, withdrawal at 
the earliest signs of tardive dyskinesia may halt its full devel-
opment. Treatment of all patients on antipsychotics must be 
carefully and regularly reviewed.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hypothermia, fluctuating 
levels of consciousness, muscular rigidity, and autonomic 
dysfunction with pallor, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, 
sweating and urinary incontinence) is a rare adverse effect of 
haloperidol and chlorpromazine. It is managed by discontin-
uing the antipsychotic, correcting fluid and electrolyte defects, 
and giving bromocriptine and sometimes dantrolene.

28.4 Drugs for Bipolar Disorders
Treatment of bipolar disorders has to take account of three 
stages: treatment of the acute episode, continuation phase 
and prophylaxis to prevent further episodes. Lithium is effec-
tive in acute mania but symptomatic control of the florid symp-
toms with an antipsychotic or benzodiazepine is often neces-
sary whilst waiting for the antimania drug to exert its effect. 
Benzodiazepines may be given during the initial stages until 
lithium becomes effective but they should not be used for long 
periods because of the risk of dependence. Lithium may be 
given concurrently with antipsychotics and treatment with the 
antipsychotic should be tailed off as lithium becomes effec-
tive. Alternatively, lithium therapy may be delayed until the 
patient’s mood is stabilized with the antipsychotic. However, 
there is a risk of neurotoxicity and increased extrapyramidal 
disorders when lithium and antipsychotics are used concur-
rently (Appendix 6c). Lithium is the mainstay of treatment 
but its narrow therapeutic range is a disadvantage. Sodium 
valproate is effective and carbamazepine may also be used.
Treatment of depressive episodes in bipolar disorders will 
mostly involve combination treatment using either lithium 
or Sodium valproate together with a tricyclic antidepressant. 
Increased adverse effects are a problem which may compro-
mise treatment.
Lithium prophylaxis should usually only be undertaken with 
specialist advice and the likelihood of recurrence considered. 
Long-term lithium therapy has been associated with thyroid 
disorders and mild cognitive and memory impairment. 
Patients should continue the treatment for longer than 3 to 5 
years only if benefit persists.
Withdrawal appears to produce high levels of relapse. If 
lithium is to be discontinued, the dose should be reduced 
gradually over a few weeks and patients should be warned of 
possible relapses if discontinued abruptly.
Lithium salts have a narrow therapeutic/toxic ratio and should 
only be prescribed if there are facilities for monitoring serum 
lithium concentrations. Doses are adjusted to achieve serum-
lithium concentrations of 0.4-1 mmol/litre (lower end of range 
for maintenance therapy and the elderly) on samples taken 
12 h after the preceding dose. The optimum range for each 
patient should be determined.
585
NFI-2011
Psychotherapeutic Drugs
Overdosage, usually with serum-lithium concentration of over 
1.5 mmol/litre may be fatal and toxic effects include coarse 
tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, renal impairment and 
convulsions. If any of these effects occur, treatment should 
be stopped, serum-lithium concentration determined and in 
mild overdosage large amounts of sodium and fluid should be 
given to reverse the toxicity; in severe toxicity, haemodialysis 
may be required.
For patients who are unresponsive to or intolerant of lithium, 
carbamazepine may be used in the prophylaxis of bipolar 
illness particularly in those with rapid cycling affective disor-
ders (more than four affective episodes per year).

28.5 Drugs Used for Obsessive Compulsive 
Disorders and Panic Attacks
Obsessive-compulsive disorders can be treated with a combi-
nation of pharmacological, behavioural and psychological 
treatments. Antidepressants such as clomipramine which 
inhibit reuptake of serotonin have been found to be effec-
tive. Panic attacks may be treated with behavioural or cogni-
tive therapy. If this management fails, drug therapy may be 
tried. Some tricyclic antidepressants including clomipramine 
or SSRIs can reduce frequency of attacks or prevent them 
completely. Benzodiazepines may be used in panic attacks 
resistant to antidepressants.

Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs
30. Vitamins, Minerals and 
Antianaemic Drugs
Vitamins:
Vitamins are used for the prevention and treatment of 
specific deficiency states or when the diet is known to be 
inadequate. It has often been suggested but never convinc-
ingly proved, that subclinical vitamin deficiencies cause much 
chronic ill-health and liability to infections. This has led to 
enormous consumption of vitamin preparations, which have 
no more than placebo value. Most vitamins are compara-
tively non-toxic but prolonged administration of high doses of 
retinol (vitamin A), ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and pyridoxine 
(vitamin B6) may have severe adverse effects.
Retinol (vitamin A) is a fat-soluble substance stored in body 
organs, principally the liver. Periodic high-dose supplementa-
tion is intended to protect against vitamin A deficiency which 
is associated with ocular defects particularly xerophthalmia 
(including night blindness which may progress to severe 
eye lesions and blindness), and an increased susceptibility 
to infections, particularly measles and diarrhoea. Universal 
vitamin A distribution involves the periodic administration 
of supplemental doses to all preschool-age children with 
priority given to age groups, 6 months to 3 years, or regions 
at greatest risk. All mothers in high-risk regions should also 
receive a high dose of vitamin A within 8 weeks of delivery. 
Since vitamin A is associated with a teratogenic effect it should 
be given in smaller doses (no more than 10,000 units/day) to 
women of child-bearing age. It is also used in the treatment 
of active xerophthalmia. Doses of vitamin A should be admin-
istered orally immediately upon diagnosis of xerophthalmia 
and thereafter patients with acute corneal lesions should 
be referred to a hospital on an emergency basis. In women 
of child-bearing age there is a need to balance the possible 
teratogenic effects of vitamin A should they be pregnant with 
the serious consequences of xerophthalmia. Where there 
are severe signs of xerophthalmia high dose treatment as for 
patients over 1 year should be given. When less severe symp-
toms are present (for example night blindness) a much lower 
dose is recommended. Vitamin A therapy should also be given 
during epidemics of measles to reduce complications.
Vitamin B is composed of widely differing substances which 
are, for convenience, classed as ‘vitamin B complex’. Thiamine 
604
NFI-2011
Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs
(vitamin B1) is used orally for deficiency due to to inadequate 
dietary intake. Severe deficiency may result in ‘beri-beri’. 
Chronic dry ‘beri-beri’ is characterized by peripheral neurop-
athy, muscle wasting and weakness, and paralysis; wet ‘beri-
beri’ is characterized by cardiac failure and oedema. Wernicke-
Korsakoff syndrome (demyelination of the CNS) may develop 
in severe deficiency. Thiamine is given by intravenous injection 
in doses of up to 300 mg daily (parenteral preparations may 
contain several B group vitamins) as initial treatment in severe 
deficiency states. Potentially severe allergic reactions may 
occur after parenteral administration. Facilities for resuscita-
tion should be immediately available. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) 
deficiency may result from reduced dietary intake or reduced 
absorption due to liver disease, alcoholism, chronic infection 
or probenecid therapy. It may also occur in association with 
other deficiency states such as pellagra. Pyridoxine (vitamin 
B6) deficiency is rare as the vitamin is widely distributed in 
foods, but deficiency may occur during isoniazid therapy and 
is characterized by peripheral neuritis. High doses are given 
in some metabolic disorders, such as hyperoxaluria and it is 
also used in sideroblastic anaemia. Nicotinic acid inhibits the 
synthesis of cholesterol and triglyceride and is used in some 
hyperlipidaemias. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are used to 
prevent and treat nicotinic acid deficiency (pellagra). Nicotina-
mide is generally preferred as it does not cause vasodilation. 
Hydroxocobalamin is the form of vitamin B12 used to treat 
vitamin B12 deficiency due to dietary deficiency or malabsorp-
tion (see chapter 13.1).
Folic acid is essential for the synthesis of DNA and certain 
proteins. Deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12 is associated 
with megaloblastic anaemia. Folic acid should not be used 
in undiagnosed megaloblastic anaemia unless vitamin B12 is 
administered concurrently, otherwise neuropathy may be 
precipitated (see chapter 13.1). Supplementation with folic 
acid 500 µg daily is recommended for women of child-bearing 
potential in order to reduce the risk of serious neural tube 
defects in their offspring.
Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used for the prevention and treat-
ment of scurvy. Claims that ascorbic acid is of value in the 
treatment of common colds are unsubstantiated.
The term vitamin D covers a range of compounds including 
ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). 
These two compounds are equipotent and either can be used 
to prevent and treat rickets.
Simple deficiency of vitamin D occurs in those who have an 
inadequate dietary intake or who fail to produce enough 
605
NFI-2011
Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in their skin from the precursor 
7-dehydrocholesterol in response to ultraviolet light.
Vitamin K is necessary for the production of blood clotting 
factors.
Minerals:
Calcium gluconate: Calcium supplements are usually only 
required where dietary calcium intake is deficient. This dietary 
requirement varies with age and is relatively greater in child-
hood, pregnancy and lactation due to an increased demand, 
and in old age, due to impaired absorption. In osteoporosis, 
a calcium intake which is double the recommended daily 
amount reduces the rate of bone loss. In hypocalcaemic 
tetany calcium gluconate must be given parenterally but 
plasma calcium must be monitored. Calcium gluconate is also 
used in cardiac resuscitation.
Iodine is among the body’s essential trace elements. The 
recommended intake of iodine is 150 µg daily (200 µg daily in 
pregnant and lactation women); in children the recommended 
intake of iodine is 50 µg daily for infants under 1 year, 90 µg daily 
for children aged 2-6 years, and 120 µg daily for children aged 
7-12 years. Deficiency causes endemic goitre and results in 
endemic cretinism (characterized by deaf-mutism, intellectual 
deficit, spasticity and sometimes hypothyroidism), impaired 
mental function in children and adults and an increased inci-
dence of still-births and perinatal and infant mortality. Iodine 
and iodides may suppress neonatal thyroid function and in 
general iodine compounds should be avoided in pregnancy. 
Where it is essential to prevent neonatal goitre and cretinism, 
iodine should not be witheld from pregnant women. Control 
of iodine deficiency largely depends upon salt iodization with 
potassium iodide or potassium iodate and through dietary 
diversification. In areas where iodine deficiency disorders are 
moderate to severe, iodized oil given either before or at any 
stage of pregnancy is found to be beneficial.
Sodium fluoride: Availability of adequate fluoride confers 
significant resistance to dental caries. It is now considered 
that the topical action of fluoride on enamel and plaque is 
more important than the systemic effect. Where the natural 
fluoride content of the drinking water is significantly less than 
1 mg per litre, artificial fluoridation is the most economical 
method of supplementing fluoride intake. Daily administra-
tion of fluoride tablets or drops is a suitable alternative, but 
systemic fluoride supplements should not be prescribed 
without reference to the fluoride content of the local water 
supply; they are not advisable when the water contains more 
than 700 µg per litre. In addition, infants need not receive 
606
NFI-2011
Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs
fluoride supplements until the age of 6 months. Dentifrices 
which incorporate Sodium fluoride are a convenient source of 
fluoride. Individuals who are either particularly caries prone 
or medically compromized may be given additional protection 
by the use of fluoride rinses or by application of fluoride gels. 
Rinses may be used daily or weekly; daily use of a less concen-
trated rinse is more effective than weekly use of a more 
concentrated one. High-strength gels must be applied on a 
regular basis under professional supervision; extreme caution 
is necessary to prevent the child from swallowing any excess.

Iron-Deficiency Anaemia:
Anaemia has many different aetiologies. It occurs when the 
haemoglobin concentration falls below the normal range for 
the age and sex of the individual. It is essential that a correct 
diagnosis is made before initiating therapy.
Any serious underlying cause of iron-deficiency anaemia, 
including gastric erosion and colonic carcinoma, should be 
excluded before giving iron replacement. Prophylaxis with 
iron salts in pregnancy should be given to women who have 
additional factors for iron-deficiency; low-dose iron and folic 
acid preparations are used for the prophylaxis of megalob-
lastic anaemia in pregnancy. 
Ferrous salts should be given orally wherever possible. They 
differ only marginally in efficiency of absorption and thus 
the choice of preparation is usually decided by incidence 
of adverse effects and cost. Ferric salts are much less well 
absorbed. The oral dose of elemental iron for treatment of 
iron-deficiency anaemia in adults should be 100-200 mg daily 
with meals.
The approximate elemental iron content of various ferrous 
salts is- ferrous fumarate 200 mg (65 mg iron), ferrous gluco-
nate 300 mg (35 mg iron), ferrous succinate 100 mg (35 mg 
iron), ferrous sulphate 300 mg (60 mg iron) and dried ferrous 
sulphate  200 mg (65 mg iron).
The haemoglobin concentration should rise by about 100-200 
mg/100 ml per day or 2 g/100 ml over 3-4 weeks. After the 
haemoglobin has risen to normal, treatment should be 
continued for a further 3 months to replenish the iron stores.
Iron intake in the evening has been reported to improve its 
absorption. Iron intake with meals may reduce bioavailability 
but improve tolerability and adherence.
If adverse effects arise with one salt, dosage can be reduced or 
a change made to an alternative iron salt but an improvement 
in tolerance may be due to lower content of elemental iron. 
Gastrointestinal irritation may occur with iron salts. Nausea 
and epigastric pain are dose-related. Iron preparations taken 
orally may be constipating, particularly in the elderly, occa-
sionally leading to faecal impaction. Oral iron may exacerbate 
diarrhoea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease but 
care is also needed in patients with intestinal strictures and 
diverticula. Iron as iron dextran (a complex of ferric hydroxide 
with dextrans) should be given parenterally only if the patient 
cannot tolerate oral iron, or does not take it reliably or there is 
615
NFI-2011
Vitamins, Minerals and Antianaemic Drugs
continuing severe blood loss or malabsorption. Many patients 
with chronic renal failure who are receiving haemodialysis 
(and some on peritoneal dialysis) require intravenous iron on 
a regular basis. Parenteral iron may cause more harm than 
benefit. With the exception of patients on haemodialysis 
the haemoglobin response is not significantly faster with the 
parenteral route than the oral route.
Megaloblastic Anaemia:
Megaloblastic anaemias result from a lack of either vitamin 
B12 (hydroxocobalamin) or folate or both. The clinical features 
of folate-deficient megaloblastic anaemia are similar to those 
of vitamin B12 deficiency except that the accompanying severe 
neuropathy does not occur; it is essential to establish the 
underlying cause in every case. Hydroxocobalamin is used 
to treat vitamin B12 deficiency whether due to dietary defi-
ciency or malabsorption including pernicious anaemia (due 
to a lack of intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin B12 
absorption).
Folate deficiency due to poor nutrition, pregnancy, antiepilep-
tics or malabsorption is treated with folic acid but this should 
never be administered without vitamin B12 in undiagnosed 
megaloblastic anaemia because of the risk of precipitating 
neurological changes due to vitamin B12 deficiency.
Preparations containing a ferrous salt and folic acid are used 
for the prevention of megaloblastic anaemia in pregnancy. The 
low doses of folic acid in these preparations are inadequate 
for the treatment of megaloblastic anaemias. 
Prevention of Neural Tube Defects:
An adequate intake of folic acid before conception and during 
early pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects in 
babies. Therefore, women planning a pregnancy should receive 
sufficient folic acid before conception and in the first 12 weeks 
of pregnancy; folic acid may be given as a food or a medicinal 
supplement in a dose of 400-500 µg daily. A woman who has 
not received supplementary folic acid and suspects that she 
might be pregnant should start taking folic acid at once and 
continue until 12th week of pregnancy.
Women at increased risk of giving birth to a baby with neural 
tube defects (for example history of neural tube defect in a 
previous child) should receive a higher dose of folic acid of 
approximately 5 mg daily, starting before conception and 
continuing for 12 weeks after conception. Women taking 
antiepileptic medication should be counselled by their doctor 
before starting folic acid.

Drug-Alcohol Interactions
Mixing alcohol with medications can cause a variety of symptoms 
like nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, fainting, or loss of 
coordination. By virtue of its effects on the CNS consumption of 
alcohol, even in small quantities, puts the patient at a high risk. There 
are medicines which should never be taken with alcohol (Table 1). 
However, there are many other medicines which should be used with 
high level of caution while the patient is on alcohol (Table 2).

with each other. The interactions may be potentiation or 
antagonism of one drug by another or occasionally some other 
effect. Drug interactions may be of pharmacokinetic or phar-
macodynamic type. The pharmacokinetic interactions can be 
because of absorption mechanism, competition of two drugs 
at the protein binding sites, metabolizing enzyme system 
or excretion. When two or more drugs are concomitantly 
administered there is always a possibility of pharmacokinetic 
or pharmacodynamic interaction. The pharmacodynamic 
interactions can be at the receptor level for competition at 
same drug target (enzyme/receptor) acting synergistically or 
antagonizing the effect of each other. The drugs which have 
narrow therapeutic window have greater potential to cause 
unexpected adverse effect when their pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics is altered. In such situation, the following 
precautions are advisable:
1.	 Concomitant administration of drugs should possibly be 
avoided.
2.	 When unavoidable, care should be taken and TDM is 
recommended.
3.	 When TDM is not possible logistically, clinical symptoma-
tology be done. 
4.	 Careful dose titration (upward/downward) be done to get 
optimum dose modification. 
The following drug categories are considered as drugs of 
narrow therapeutic window:
Antiepileptics, anticoagulants, anticancers, xanthenes, antide-
pressants, antiarrhythmics etc.

Food can also impact the effectiveness of a drug due to the 
way it is consumed. Generally, medicine is to be taken almost 
at the same time the food is eaten. This is because the 
medicine may upset the stomach if the stomach is empty. 
Certain medications are recommended to be taken with food

Appendix 7a: Hepatic Impairment
Dosing considerations in hepatic impairment
Hepatobiliary system plays an important role in the interac-
tions between drugs and the body. Liver diseases can affect 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs. 
However there has to be moderate to severe hepatic impair-
ment to significantly alter the response to drugs as liver has a 
large reserve capacity. Hepatic impairment may alter response 
to drugs not only because of its role in metabolism of drugs 
but it also affects their absorption and distribution. Looking at 
the importance of liver in dealing with the drug, knowledge of 
a patient’s hepatic function is required for the safe prescribing 
of many drugs. Unlike renal disease, where estimation of 
renal function based on creatinine clearance can fairly help 
in knowing the drug elimination and hence dose adjustment, 
there is no endogenous marker for hepatic clearance that can 
be used as a guide for drug dosing. 
Hepatic impairment can lead to altered response to drugs due 
to all or some of the following reasons:
Metabolism of many drugs depend on adequate liver 
•	
function. Generally, metabolism result in the loss 
of pharmacological activity and therefore reduced 
metabolism in case of impaired liver function can 
lead to the accumulation of drug in the body to the 
toxic level at the normal dose. However in some cases 
drugs are metabolised to the active form and in these 
drugs normal dose may not be able to achieve desired 
response.
For drugs with low bioavailability (high hepatic extrac-
•	
tion), bioavailability increases and hepatic clearance 
decreases in cirrhotic patients. If such drug is to be 
administered orally to cirrhotic patients, their initial 
dose has to be reduced according to their hepatic 
extraction. For drugs with low bioavailability (low 
hepatic extraction), hepatic clearance may be affected 
due to impaired metabolism. For such drugs only the 
maintenance dose has to be adjusted according to esti-
mated decrease in their hepatic metabolism.
Portal hypertensive gastropathy and ulcers of upper 
•	
gastrointestinal tract, frequently seen in cirrhotic 
patients may alter the absorption of orally adminis-
tered drugs. Absorption of drugs may be increased 
because of high intestinal permeability in patients 
702
NFI-2011
with portal hypertension. Impaired gastrointestinal 
motility seen in cirrhotic patients can lead to delayed 
drug absorption
Volume of distribution of hydrophilic drugs is 
•	
increased due to presence of oedema and/or ascitis. 
Hence, loading dose of these drugs may have to be 
increased if a rapid action is required. On the other 
hand increase in volume of distribution is associated 
with an increase in the elimination half life of such 
drugs.
Impaired elimination of drugs which are excreted in 
•	
the bile can lead to their accumulation in the body.
Impaired albumin production can lead to decreased 
•	
protein binding and increased toxicity of highly plasma 
protein bound drugs.
High percentage of drugs may reach systemic circu-
•	
lation without passing through liver due to develop-
ment of portosystemic shunts in cirrhotic patients.
Cirrhotic patients can often have impaired renal func-
•	
tion and in these cases dosage of the drugs have to be 
carefully adjusted.
The use of certain drugs in patients with cirrhosis may 
increase the risk of hepatic decompensation. In patients with 
impaired liver function dose related hepatotoxic reaction 
may occur at lower doses. Drugs that cause fluid retention 
(for example, prednisolone, ibuprofen, dexamethasone etc.) 
may exacerbate oedema and ascitis in chronic liver disease. 
Sensitivity of brain to depressant action of some drugs( for 
example, morphine and barbiturates) is markedly increased in 
cirrhotic patients and can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy 
at normal doses.
As evident from above, there is a complex interactions 
between the drugs and liver function. Absence of any endog-
enous marker for hepatic clearance makes it highly difficult 
to accurately adjust the dose of various drugs in hepatic 
impairment. Therefore, if no immediate pharmacological 
effect is needed, drug therapy should be started cautiously in 
these patients and titrated individually until desired effect is 
achieved or toxicity appears. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic 
range and low hepatic extraction for e.g. theophylline are the 
most dangerous drugs. If such drugs are administered orally, 
both loading dose and maintenance doses have to be reduced 
by ≥ 50% of the normal dose, depending on the severity of 
hepatic impairment.

Appendix 7b: Lactation
Administration of some drugs (for example, ergotamine) to 
nursing mothers may harm the infant, whereas administration 
of others (for example, digoxin) has little effect. Some drugs 
inhibit lactation (for example, estrogens).
Toxicity to the infant can occur if the drug enters the milk in 
pharmacologically significant quantities. The concentration in 
milk of some drugs (for example, iodides) may exceed that in 
the maternal plasma so that therapeutic doses in the mother 
may cause toxicity to the infant. Some drugs inhibit the infant’s 
sucking reflex (for example, phenobarbital). Drugs in breast 
milk may, at least theoretically, cause hypersensitivity in the 
infant even when the concentration is too low for a pharma-
cological effect.
The following table lists drugs:
•	
which should be used with caution or which are contrain-
dicated in lactation for the reasons given above;
•	
which are not known to be harmful to the infant although 
they are present in milk in significant amounts.
For many drugs insufficient evidence is available to provide 
guidance and it is advisable to administer only drugs essential 
to a mother during lactation. Because of the inadequacy of 
information on drugs in breast milk the following table should 
be used only as a guide; absence from the table does not 
imply safety.

Appendix 7c: Pregnancy
Drugs can have harmful effects on the fetus at any time during 
pregnancy. It is important to remember this when prescribing for a 
woman of childbearing age. However, irrational fear of using drugs 
during pregnancy can also result in harm. This includes untreated 
illness, impaired maternal compliance, suboptimal treatment and 
treatment failures. Major congenital malformations occur in 2–4% 
of all live births, 15% of all diagnosed pregnancies will result in 
fetal loss. During the first trimester drugs may produce congenital 
malformations (teratogenesis), and the greater risk is from third 
to the eleventh week of pregnancy. During the second and third 
trimester, drugs may affect the growth and functional development 
of the fetus or have toxic effects on fetal tissues. Drugs given shortly 
before term or during labor may have adverse effects on labor or on 
the neonate after delivery. Few drugs have been shown conclusively 
to be teratogenic in man but no drug is safe beyond all doubt in early 
pregnancy. Screening procedures are available where there is a known 
risk of certain defects.
Prescribing in Pregnancy
Since, approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned and 
rest 50% are planned, if possible, counseling of women before a 
planned pregnancy should be carried out including discussion of 
risks associated with specific therapeutic agents, traditional drugs 
(alternative medicines), over the counter drugs and substances 
of abuse such as opioids, smoking, alcohol etc. Drugs should be 
prescribed in pregnancy only if the expected benefits to the mother 
are thought to be greater than the risk to the fetus. All drugs should be 
avoided if possible during the first trimester. Drugs which have been 
used extensively in pregnancy and appear to be usually safe should 
be prescribed in preference to new or untried drugs and the smallest 
effective dose should be used. Keeping in view the prevalence of 
irrational polypharmacy, emphasis should be laid on promoting the 
use of well known single component drugs to multicomponent drugs. 
Since, there does appear to be an association of very potent topical 
corticosteroids with low birth weight, even the dermatological drug 
products being used should be cautiously selected and used. 
The pronounced and progressive change in drug disposition that occurs 
during pregnancy is another major reason which calls for attention. 
Major physiological changes which influence drug disposition in mother 
and fetus are:
S. No
Physiologic changes
Effects
1.
Plasma albumin 
concentration of mother is 
reduced
Drug protein binding 
alteration
2.
Increased body fat in 
mother
Distribution of drug is 
effected
3.
Increased hepatic 
metabolism in mother
Faster hepatic clearance
721
NFI-2011
4.
Increased cardiac output 
in mother
Increased renal blood flow 
and glomerular filtration 
and hence, increased 
elimination of drug
5.
Presence of placental 
barrier
Selectivity of drug 
permeation based on its 
hydrophobicity or molecular 
weight of drug
6.
Drug metabolizing 
enzymes activity in fetal 
liver is very low
Slow elimination of drugs 
by fetus
Though maternal medication carry the risk of increase in the 
incidence of abortion, stillbirths, fetal death, premature or delayed 
labor or create perinatal problems; but certain medications like folic 
acid are recommended for all pregnant women to reduce the rate of 
congenital anomalies specifically, the neural tube defect. 
The Food and Drug Administration has categorized the drug risks to 
the fetus that runs from: “Category A” (safest) to “Category X” (known 
danger--do not use!)
Category A
Controlled studies in women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus 
in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later 
trimesters), and the possibility of fetal harm appears remote.
Category B
Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk 
but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal-
reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a 
decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in 
women in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of a risk in later 
trimesters).
Category C
Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus 
(teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlled 
studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. 
Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.
Category D
There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefits from 
use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the 
drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease 
for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective).
Category X
Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal 
abnormalities, or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human 
experience or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant 
women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is 
contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.

Appendix 7d: Renal Impairment
Dosing considerations in renal impairment
The number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
and reduced renal function have been inexorably increasing. 
Reduced renal function may need adjustment in drug therapy 
as kidney plays a major role in the pharmacokinetics of a large 
number of drugs. 
Renal insufficiency frequently alters drug distribution 
•	
volume. Edema and ascites increase the apparent 
volume of distribution of highly water-soluble or 
protein-bound drugs. Usual doses of such drugs given 
to edematous patients result in inadequate, low 
plasma levels. 
The alteration of plasma protein binding in patients 
•	
with renal insufficiency is an important factor affecting 
both efficacy and toxicity. In patients with uremia the 
unbound fraction of several acidic drugs is substan-
tially increased which may lead to serious toxicity.
Although renal insufficiency is thought to affect 
•	
primarily the renal elimination of drugs or metabo-
lites, renal failure substantially affects drug biotrans-
formation. Uremia slows the rate of reduction and 
hydrolysis reactions.
Many active or toxic metabolites are produced during 
•	
drug metabolism. Many of these metabolites depend 
on the kidneys for their removal from the body. The 
accumulation of active metabolites can explain in part 
the high incidence of ADRs seen in renal failure.
A few points should be kept in mind while 
prescribing;
Renal function declines with age so that by the age of 
•	
80 it is half that in healthy young subjects.
It is advisable to determine renal function not only 
•	
before but also during the period of treatment and 
adjust the maintenance dose as necessary.
One should try to keep drug prescription to 
•	
minimum.
Nephrotoxic drugs should, if possible, be avoided in 
•	
all patients with renal disease because the nephrotox-
icity is more likely to be serious.
723
NFI-2011
One should stay alert for unexpected ADRs.
•	
The recommendations in the table below are meant only as a 
guide and do not imply efficacy or safety of a recommended 
dose in an individual patient.
A loading dose equivalent to the usual dose in patients with 
normal renal function should be considered for drugs with a 
particularly long half-life.
The table below gives the common drugs where in renal 
impairment dose adjustment is required. 
When the dose method (D) is suggested, the percentage of the 
dose for normal renal function is given and when the interval 
method (I) is suggested, the actual dose interval is provided.

Principles of Dose Calculation in 
Special Conditions
A. Dosing considerations for the pediatric 
patient
Determination of a safe and effective drug dose for the pedi-
atric patient is essential for the treating physician. Doses 
and dosing intervals in children differ from that of an adult 
because of age-related variations in drug absorption, distri-
bution, metabolism, and elimination. Oral drug absorption 
matures by four to five months of age. Drugs like phenytoin 
and chloramphenicol are absorbed slowly and erratically 
whereas penicillin and ampicillin are absorbed more effi-
ciently than in the adults because of a higher gastric pH in the 
neonates. Most drug metabolizing enzymes are expressed at 
low levels at birth followed by postnatal induction of specific 
isoenzymes. For most drugs including phenytoin, barbiturates, 
digoxin and analgesics the plasma half lives are 2-3 times 
longer in neonates as compared to adults. Renal elimination 
of drugs is also reduced in the neonates. As a result, neonatal 
dosing regimens for a number of drugs must be reduced to 
avoid toxicity. Drug pharmacodynamics may also be different 
in children, for e.g. antihistamines and barbiturates that are 
generally sedative in adults may be excitatory in pediatric age 
group. Similarly, specific drug toxicities may be unique to this 
age group as evident in case of tetracyclines affecting teeth 
and glucocorticoids reducing linear growth of bones. 
Because of these maturational differences in infants and chil-
dren, simple proportionate reduction in the adult dose may 
not be adequate to determine an optimal pediatric dose. The 
most reliable dose information is usually the one provided by 
the drug manufacturer in the package insert or pediatric doses 
listed in the formulary. However, such information is not avail-
able for the majority of drugs since proper dose optimization 
studies are often not performed in the pediatric age range. 
Consequently, initial doses are derived by scaling down the 
dosages used in adults and then titrating according to clinical 
response. 
In the absence of specific pediatric dose recommendations, 
an estimate can be made by any of several methods based on 
age, weight, or surface area. 
735
NFI-2011
Age- based rules:
Various rules of dosage in which the pediatric dose is a frac-
tion of adult dose based on relative age have been used. Two 
of these are mentioned below.
Young’s rule (for children 2 years and older)
Child’s dose (approx.) =
Age (years)
x Adult dose
Age(years) + 12
Fried’s rule (for children up to 2 years old)
Child’s dose (approx.) =
Age (months)
x Adult dose
150
Weight based rule:
Because of large variability in weight among children of same 
age group, estimation of drug dosage for children on the basis 
of body weight is considered more reliable than that based 
solely on age. A rule proposed by Professor A. J. Clark ( known 
as the Clark’s rule) introduced weight proportional regimen 
for drug therapy.
Child’s dose (approx.) =
Weight ( kg)
x Adult dose
70
Body surface area based rule:
The most dependable methods for calculation of pediatric 
drug doses are those based on body surface area (BSA). Rate 
of metabolism and redistribution of drug, organ size, blood 
volume, extracellular fluid volume, renal blood flow and 
assays of blood concentration of drugs correlate closely with 
the BSA. 
Child’s dose (approx.) =
Weight ( kg)
x Adult dose
1.73 m2
For calculation of doses based on BSA, standard nomogram 
which includes both body weight and height as factors deter-
mining BSA should be used. To calculate a child’s BSA, draw a 
straight line from the height column to the weight column. The 
point at which the line intersects the surface area (SA) column 
is the BSA (m2). If the child is of roughly normal proportion, 
BSA can be calculated from the weight alone (in the enclosed 
area).

The above mentioned rules are helpful in situations requiring 
the use of a drug that is unlicensed in children and for which 
no pediatric prescribing information is available. However, 
these rules are not precise and doses should not be calculated 
if it is possible to obtain the actual pediatric dose. Whatever 
be the method chosen to calculate the child’s dose, it should 
never exceed that of the adult.

B. Dosing considerations for the geriatric 
patient
Aging is a natural process of human development and is char-
acterized by a progressive loss of physiologic and reproductive 
functions. Altered response to drugs with aging occurs at both 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels.
Pharmacokinetic changes occur with the age as a result of the 
inevitable anatomical and physiological changes which occur 
with time, such as loss of an organ’s functional units (neph-
rons, neurons) and distruption of some regulatory processes 
between cells and organs, resulting in decrease in function of 
body systems. For example, first pass metabolism decreases 
due to decrease in liver mass and blood flow, resulting in an 
increase in bioavailability of drugs which undergo extensive 
first pass metabolism, for example, propranolol. Another 
example of a pharmacokinetic change is the reduced clear-
ance of renally-cleared drugs due to reduced renal plasma 
flow and glomerular filtration. This increases the potential for 
toxic effects particularly with those drugs where even marginal 
accumulation can have toxic effects, for example digoxin and 
lithium. Changes in body composition such as increase in 
body fat proportion and decrease in total body water result 
in a decreased volume of distribution for water soluble drugs 
such as digoxin, which increases their serum concentrations 
and potential for adverse effects. 
Geriatric patients are much more “sensitive” to the action of 
many drugs, implying a change in the pharmacodynamic inter-
actions of the drugs with their receptors. Elderly are more 
sensitive to some sedative-hypnotics and analgesics. Certain 
homeostatic control mechanisms appear to be blunted in 
elderly. Since homeostatic responses are often important 
components of the total response to a drug, these physiolog-
ical alterations may change the pattern or intensity of drug 
response.
The age-related changes in the functions and composition of 
the human body require adjustments of drug selection and 
dosage for old individuals. Drug excretion via the kidneys 
declines with age, the elderly should therefore be treated as 
renally insufficient patients. A rough estimate of creatinine 
clearance can be obtained from the Cockcroft-Gault formula:
Creatinine clearance = 
( ml/min)
(140 - Age) x (Weight in kg)
(for males)
72 x serum creatinine in 
mg/dL
   	
	
	
	
          	
  
Appendix 13
738
NFI-2011
For females, the result is multiplied by 0.85. The formula is 
applicable to patients between the age of 40 and 80.
The metabolic clearance is primarily reduced with drugs that 
display high hepatic extraction (‘blood flow-limited metabo-
lism’), whereas the metabolism of drugs with low hepatic 
extraction (‘capacity-limited metabolism’) usually is not 
diminished. Reduction of metabolic drug elimination is more 
pronounced in malnourished or frail subjects. The water 
content of the aging body decreases, the fat content rises, 
hence the distribution volume of hydrophilic compounds 
is reduced in the elderly, whereas that of lipophilic drugs is 
increased. Intestinal absorption of most drugs is not altered 
in the elderly. Aside of these pharmacokinetic changes, one 
of the characteristics of old age is a progressive decline in 
counterregulatory (homeostatic) mechanisms. Therefore drug 
effects are mitigated less, the reactions are usually stronger 
than in younger subjects, the rate and intensity of adverse 
effects are higher. Examples of drug effects augmented in 
this manner are, postural hypotension with agents that lower 
blood pressure, dehydration, hypovolemia, and electrolyte 
disturbances in response to diuretics, bleeding complications 
with oral anticoagulants, hypoglycemia with antidiabetics, and 
gastrointestinal irritation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs. The brain is an especially sensitive drug target in old 
age. Psychotropic drugs but also anticonvulsants and centrally 
acting antihypertensives may impede intellectual functions 
and motor coordination. The antimuscarinic effects of some 
antidepressants and neuroleptic drugs may be responsible 
for agitation, confusion, and delirium in elderly. Hence drugs 
should be used very restrictively in geriatric patients. If drug 
therapy is absolutely necessary, the dosage should be titrated 
to a clearly defined clinical or biochemical therapeutic goal 
starting from a low initial dose.

Appendix 14: Storage of Drugs
1. Definition and Concept
1.1. Storage 
The term used to describe the safe keeping of all finished 
drugs and pharmaceuticals awaiting dispatch. The term is also 
applied for safe stores in hospitals and dispensaries under 
the specified conditions, so as to maintain their quality and 
potency. 
1.2. Storage Conditions
The condition specified for storing the product e.g. tempera-
ture, humidity, container etc.
1.3. Quality
The ability of drug product to satisfy the users need.
1.4. Dosage Form
Refers to the gross physical form in which a drug is adminis-
tered to or used by a patient.
1.5. Drug Product
A dosage form containing one or more active therapeutic 
ingredients along with other substance included during manu-
facturing process.
1.6. Finished Product
A medicinal product which has completed all stages of manu-
facture including packaging.
1.7. Strength 
The concentration of the drug substance (for example weight/
weight, weight/volume or unit dose/volume basis) and the 
potency i.e. the therapeutic activity of the drug product as 
indicated by appropriate laboratory tests or by adequately 
developed and controlled clinical data (expressed, for example 
in terms of units by reference to a standard).
1.8. Stability 
Degree of resistance to chemical and physical changes, the 
efficacy of the preparation must remain constant or change 
only within the limit specified by official compendia.
1.9. Expiration Date 
The date placed on the immediate container label of a drug 
product that designates the date through which the product 
is expected to remain within specifications. Kinetically it is the 
740
NFI-2011
time required for 10 % of the material to disappear.
2. Storage Procedure and Instructions 
Drugs must be stored under conditions which minimize dete-
rioration, contamination or damage. They must be stored 
under conditions compatible with their recommended storage 
requirements of temperature and humidity and where neces-
sary to comply with legal requirements, under secured or 
segregated conditions.
Appropriate storage conditions are: 
Temperature or humidity controlled environment must be 
equipped with suitable indicators, recorders and/or failure 
warning devices which must be checked at appropriate inter-
vals and the results are coded. Recording thermometers 
should be used. Temperature in uncontrolled storage prod-
ucts should also be monitored.
Temperature should be measured at different levels in the 
warehouse and if necessary storage of sensitive drugs should 
be restricted to locations in the warehouse where they will 
be protected from extreme conditions. Temperatures of 
the refrigerators, deep freezers, and Relative Humidity in 
humidity control area as well as general areas of storage at 
room temperature should be recorded on a daily basis.
Storage conditions not related to temperature are indicated 
in following terms:
Drug storage should be regularly checked for cleanliness and 
good order and for misplaced/deteriorated/out dated stock. 
All stocks should be checked regularly for obsolescence and 
degradation. Drugs with expired shelf life should be destroyed 
unless an extension of shelf life is granted following the satis-
factory results or re-analysis. All due precautions should be 
observed to preclude issues of outdated Drugs. 
Some categories of supplies require special storage condi-
tions which include vaccines, narcotics, and combustibles e.g. 
vaccines require both refrigerator and freezers.
Narcotics and other controlled substances should be kept in 
secure locking rooms with only one entrance. The keys should 
be kept in a secure place, preferably a safe. Only the ware-
house director and one another person should have access 
to them.
3. Inspection for Deterioration 
Pharmacists should be aware that deterioration of drug 
product may happen even before their expiration. This may 
occur perhaps due to improper storage or the fact that the 
product may require critical storage conditions not stated on 
Appendix 14
741
NFI-2011
the label. Hence inspection should include frequent product 
examination to detect signs of product deterioration which 
differ according to dosage form. Some examples, where 
deterioration may be physically detected are given here. The 
Pharmacists in the Stores should prepare an exhaustive list of 
following deterioration/spoilage indicators and keep them.
3.1. Liquid Dosage Forms
Slight gradual discolouration, Swirly precipitation, Whickering: 
pin hole at ampoule tip that leaks solution which precipitate 
or crystalline solid matter, clouding, fading of colour, Cake 
sedimentation (suspension), Creaming and cracking (emul-
sion), Discolouration.
3.2. Semisolid Dosage Forms
Ointments creams, gels and suppositories -Change in consist-
ency and feel to touch, Phase separation, Discolouration, 
Surface crystal growth 
3.3. Solid Dosage Forms
Surface chipping or pitting (plain tablets), Deformation 
(capsules), Increased hardness, Discolouration, Colour fading 
(coloured tablets), Chipping of coat (coated tablets). 
Most vitamins, hormones enzymes are highly sensitive to 
oxidation and photo decomposition.
The integrity of packaging of dosage form is one of the impor-
tant tasks of inspection for pharmacist as these protect the 
drug in a tailored fashion.
After each inspection, products showing any signs of instability 
should be subjected to sample analysis to ensure quality.
Appendix 14
742
NFI-2011
4. Drug Products Requiring Special Storage 
Conditions 
4.1. Aerosols
Aerosols should be stored in a clean separate area away from 
heat and sunlight because the container contents are under 
pressure, filled containers must be checked for weight loss 
over the expiration dating period, for contents under pres-
sure. The label should display “Do not expose to heat or store 
at a temperature above 40⁰C, keep out of reach of children”.
4.2. Creams
Creams can be destroyed under extreme temperature fluctua-
tions hence they should be stored at temperature above 10oC 
and not exceeding 30⁰C. If the creams are opened and diluted 
they should not be kept for more than 14 days to avoid micro-
bial contamination.
4.3. Ophthalmic Solutions and Drops
They should be stored according to the conditions specified on 
the label. After opening they should not be used for more than 
one month at home and not more than 15 days in hospitals.
4.4. Capsules 
Extremes of humidity and temperature should be avoided. 
High humidity (> 60% RH) at 21⁰C to 24⁰C produce more 
lasting effects. Capsules become softer, tackier and blotted. If 
temperature is increased the capsule shells may melt and fuse 
together. High temperature (>40⁰C) in dry place may cause 
cracking of capsule shell therefore capsules should be stored 
in air-conditioned area in which the humidity does not exceed 
45% RH at 21 to 24⁰C.
4.5. Suppositories
Suppositories should be protected from heat and preferably 
stored in the refrigerator. Polyethylene glycol supposito-
ries and suppositories enclosed in solid shell are less prone 
to distortion at temperature slightly above body tempera-
ture. Glycerinated gelatin suppositories should be protected 
from heat, moisture and dry air by packaging in well sealed 
containers and storing in a cold place.
4.6. Vaccines 
Liquid vaccines are to be stored between 2⁰ - 8⁰C and 
should not be frozen. All lyophilized vaccines should be stored 
between 2⁰ - 8⁰C and for long term storage can be kept at or 
below -20⁰C or otherwise as specified in the individual mono-
graphs. Oral polio should be stored in a freezer -2⁰ to -18⁰C. 
Appendix 14
743
NFI-2011
5. Communicating the Prescription to the 
Patient
It is important that the drugs reach the patient in good and 
potent conditions and the patient should know and under-
stand fully how to keep them till they are consumed. It is 
equally important that the patient should know the way each 
medicine is used. This will improve compliance and health 
outcome desired by the physician. 
Communicating how and where to store the drugs 
to the Patient:
The following table may be used to guide and provide infor-
mation on the way to store the drugs when they are dispensed 
to the patients. This is based on the recommended storage 
conditions as given on the labels of the drug products and 
Indian Pharmacopoeial notes in the General Chapters.

cupboard/drawer or in a box 
with lid closed, in any part 
of the house, except in Bath 
room/Kitchen or near or in 
the window area.
Transit period care and Use of Cool Packs:
It is equally important to ensure that patients who carry 
drugs requiring special storage conditions like anti-cancer 
drugs, several types of insulins, vaccines, sera, toxoids, would 
need to carry them in cold conditions till they reach the place 
where they will keep for some time before usage or to another 
hospital/nursing home till it is administered. In such cases 
during transit they need to be packed in “Thermo cool boxes 
with lid”, (#) with the drug product packs kept surrounded by 
adequate number of “Cool Packs”.(#) “Cool Packs are avail-
able which come ready filled with such special liquid in sealed 
bags or plastic packs, which on keeping overnight in freezer 
compartment of a refrigerator becomes solid ice. Such packs 
help in keeping the drug products in the box retain tempera-
tures below 8⁰C for as much as 8 to 10 hours, which is gener-
ally adequate for transit protection. In case such cool packs 
are not available, it is recommended to use normal “Hot 
cases” (#) that people use to carry food, but stuffing the inside 
of the hot case boxes with sufficient ice cubes surrounding 
the drug packs kept inside, and the hot case suitably closed 
and sealed with sealing tapes. Cool packs can also be made 
by packing sufficient ice cubes into suitable sized self sealing 
polybags. (#) Several Pharmacists are known to innovate this 
way and they do serve for short transit times of up to one to 
two hours.

Appendix 15:  
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is defined as measure-
ment of drug levels in the biological fluids usually blood (serum 
or plasma). It has been carried out in saliva, urine, sweat, tear 
fluids etc also. It is carried out for specific drugs at various time 
intervals in order to maintain a relatively constant concentra-
tion of the particular drug in the bloodstream and to optimize 
drug therapy. The main focus of TDM is on drugs with narrow 
therapeutic range. Apart from this, it also plays a significant 
role for drugs having large inter-individual variations; rela-
tively toxic drugs used in concomitant disease conditions, 
for escalation of dose, drugs showing wide variation in their 
metabolism, major organ failure, poisoning cases, failure of 
therapeutic response, to enhance patient compliance, etc. It is 
very important in such situations in which the drugs are to be 
taken on chronic or life long basis (chronic disease conditions 
such as bipolar disorder, organ transplant rejection, neurolog-
ical disorders etc.). The timing and frequency of blood collec-
tion after the medication and correct interpretation of results 
of analysis and their correlation with clinical features ensures 
the best therapeutic outcome.
Indications for drug monitoring:
Drugs whose efficacy is difficult to establish clinically, 
•	
like Phenytoin. 
Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Examples: 
•	
Lithium, phenytoin, digoxin. 
Patients who have impaired clearance of a drug with 
•	
a narrow therapeutic index. Example: Patients with 
renal failure have decreased clearance of digoxin and 
therefore are at a higher risk of toxicity. 
Drugs whose toxicity is difficult to distinguish from a 
•	
patient’s underlying disease. Example: Patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with 
theophylline. 
When not to do TDM
1. 	 Drugs whose pharmacological effects can easily be 
used to dose titration, like oral hypoglycemic agents, 
anti-hypertensive drugs.
2. 	 When easier and/or cheaper methods/alternatives to 
TDM are available to titrate the drug like International 
normalized ratio(INR) for warfarin.
746
NFI-2011
Time of sample collection 
1.	 Sample should be collected after steady state has been 
reached (5 half lives), unless TDM is intended to predict 
toxicity after single dose.
2.	 Usually “trough” concentrations are measured by taking 
the sample just before the subsequent dose.
3.	 Drugs whose half-lives are much shorter than the dosing 
interval, the peak and trough levels may be indicated to 
evaluate the dosage of drugs. Example: Gentamicin 
TDM could be affected because of one or more of the factors 
relating to pharmacokinetics of the drug, or drug administra-
tion, or sample collection. Renal and hepatic alterations to 
half-life must also be considered. Laboratory variations also 
affect the TDM.
